I've been fairly off the radar the last few months, mostly because of my ongoing battle with depression. I'm winning it, by the way. Takes more than that to get me.\nAnyway. In addition to empeoed, I also frequented Imzy. But they announced that they're shutting down on 6/23. I never used the cesspool called voat, but I hear they're teetering on the edge too.\nThat said, how's Empeopled's health these days? Other than being annoyed by posts with gratuitous accent marks, I've been seeing not a lot of activity on my feed. I'd be hella sad if this place went away too.\nHow is everyone? Things ok?",

Michigan's GDP is 382 billion, whereas Sweden's is 511 billion.",

For young armed-forces recruits who are still uncertain of their footing in the male world, the gruff camaraderie of barracks life may provide a reassuringly masculine setting. For some, it may do the opposite.\nThat human truth, never publicly acknowledged by the top brass, may be one reason the Pentagon so bitterly resisted President Clinton's campaign promise to drop the ban on gays in the military. The administration is offering a compromise this week that would allow gays to serve as long as they did not advertise their sexual preference. It remains unclear how this \"don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue\" policy will actually be implemented in the ranks. But no solution can do more than paper over an uncomfortable reality of life in the trenches: that the male bonding so prized by military commanders -- the willingness to die for one's buddies -- can engender another kind of closeness as well.",

Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, and Brett Erlich, the hosts of The Young Turks, tell you how.\n\u201cNews that a slight dietary change could dramatically reduce the amount of environmentally harmful methane gas released by cattle has been given an enthusiastic welcome by Irish farmers.\nResearchers at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia, found the addition of less than 2 per cent dried seaweed to a cow\u2019s diet could reduce their methane emissions by as much as 99 per cent.\nThe study builds on the experience of a Canadian farmer who discovered in 2012 that cattle eating wind-blown seaweed were not just more healthy than others, but enjoyed a longer mating cycle. Researchers Rob Kinley and Alan Fredeen subsequently confirmed the results as well as finding seaweeds and similar plants reduced methane emissions.\nThis was further substantiated by the Australian study, which was led by Prof of Aquaculture Rocky De Nys in collaboration with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.\nAgriculture and transport are the largest contributors to Ireland\u2019s climate change emissions and there have long been suggestions that the population should eat fewer burgers and steaks in an effort to reduce cattle numbers and protect the environment.\nThe gas is released via burps and flatulence by the estimated 1.5 billion cows as a byproduct of their biology. Cows, with the help of stomach bacteria, digest their food through a process called enteric fermentation, which allows them to live on a cellulose-heavy diet of grass.\u201d\n#TYT",

John Iadarola and Jayar Jackson, hosts of The Young Turks, discuss.\n\"Where do you fit on the earnings scale?\nAccording to data compiled by Goldman Sachs, most American workers earn below $20 per hour. Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Chris Mischaikow crunched Labor Department data that is used to generate the monthly jobs report that the market closely watches, in particular from the survey of employers.\nThe chart, shown above, shows that 19% of workers make less than $12.50 per hour, 32% of workers make between $12.50 and $20 per hour, 30% make between $20 and $30 an hour, 14% make between $30 and $45 per hour, and 5% make over $45 an hour.\n(It\u2019s important to note that this includes all workers covered by the establishment survey, not just hourly workers; to convert annual pay to hourly pay, divide by 2080, for a standard 40-hour week.)\nThe economists also found that, while wage growth has been soft, the fastest growth in income has come to the lowest-paid workers.\nAnd they found that the biggest driver to income growth has been rising employment, with help from rising wages and more hours worked.\u201d*\n#TYT",

    "votes": 29,
    "content": "Biologists from California think they may have figured it out. As they wrote in the journal Behavioral Ecology recently, different parts of the panda may have distinct reasons for being black or white. Overall, though, it\u2019s favorable for pandas to have both colors because they don\u2019t hibernate. And if you don\u2019t hibernate, you have to have markings that work in both the winter and the summer. Polar bears don\u2019t hibernate, but they\u2019re only ever living in the snow (although soon that won\u2019t be true), so they\u2019re all white. Black and brown bears hibernate during the winter, so they can have darker coats without worrying about standing out against the white wintery backdrop. Pandas don\u2019t hibernate, though. Bamboo isn\u2019t nutritious enough for them to store up the kind of fat reserves that they\u2019d need to survive the long sleep, so they roam around all year looking for food. That means they need versatile wardrobes. In the winter, their white bodies help them blend into the snow. In the summer, their black areas help them hide in the shade of the forest.\nThe eye spots have a more specific use: communication. Panda patches are fairly specific to the individual, and previous studies have shown that pandas can identify each other using their black eye markings. It\u2019s also possible that the black spots help to enlarge the eyes, making the stares they use as an aggressive signal more intimidating. They try to hide their faces when they\u2019re trying to be less dominant, and goodness knows a giant bear covering its eyes with its paws isn\u2019t scary. It\u2019s almost painfully sweet.",

As you can probably tell already, this installment of Fan Service will be a little different from our articles on TV, book and movie series. Usually, Fan Service recommends a watch or read order that will help you get the most out of a series. Here, the intent is to recommend a selection of really good Metroidvanias that demonstrate the genre's core tenets without too much mixing of other game genres.3 The list is broken up into three parts: the best \"Metroid\" games, the best \"Castlevania\" games and the best of the rest that fit into the genre. There's a lot of terminology that gets thrown around when talking about Metroidvanias; rest assured you'll get definitions for each.",

    "title": "I've been playing Stellaris lately. Here are my thoughts.",
    "votes": 31,
    "content": "I bought this game on launch day, but quickly grew tired of it then. If I was to describe version 1.0 of Stellaris with a single word: Dull.\nMore than a year has passed since then, with several content patches and DLC pieces. I found myself longing for sci-fi strategy, and figured it was time to give Stellaris another chance.\nI bought the two DLC that promised actual content (skipping the one that Steam reviews say is merely cosmetic), and started a new game with a randomised race on a standard sized map on standard difficulty, ironman mode. My race turned out to be militaristic xenophobes. Should be fun!\nThe first few hours were indeed fun. Exploring the galactic neighbourhood, colonising nearby planets, researching anomalies, encountering giant space animals, meeting (and insulting) neighbouring empires. Classic 4x stuff. This differs from most games by Paradox Development Studios, where you'll typically find a (mostly) full map from the outset. It strains disbelief a little having so many civilisations discover FTL flight at the same time, but it's mitigated a bit by finding the galaxy populated by a few already established empires (some that discovered FTL flight decades ago, some that have been in a state of stagnancy for centuries, and some that seem inspired by the city states in Civilization V with no good explanation behind them).\nI soon found myself with no available planets to settle, and declared war on a weak neighbour. War in this game can be frustrating, because it's hard to actually intercept enemy fleets, hard to know where they are when they're not within sensor range, risky to split your own fleet because battles are usually over by the time reinforcements can arrive, and impossible to conquer a planet without fleet support. Eventually I did manage to hunt down the enemy fleet though, which let me finally bombard their planets and conquer them, and I ended up winning my first war. And that was fun. I enslaved their populations and forced them to work in my mineral mines, then built slave armies to prepare for the next war. And I could send slaves to colonise planets that were uninhabitable to my own people, allowing me to grow my empire peacefully.\nThen once more I started preparing for war, but this time I didn't have any good targets. All the weak neighbours were allied with more powerful neighbours. This isn't uncommon in PDS games; often you find yourself waiting for an opportunity to strike, but this highlighted the major flaw with Stellaris: There's nothing to do in peace time!\nMost PDS games feature espionage in some way, and that's what I found myself wishing I could spend time on now. It would be fun to send undercover agents to neighbouring empires to sow dissent, assassinate key people, encourage slave rebellions, steal technology, things like that. Instead I just found myself waiting, while watching TV or browsing the web on my phone to pass time. When a game forces you to use some other media to pass time while playing, that is not a sign of great game design.\nThe waiting also highlighted another issue: When the galaxy gets populated by hundreds of planets and ships, the game starts to progress more slowly, as my computer fans start humming louder in a desperate attempt to keep the overworked CPU cool. Some PDS games have this problem when they near end-game, but with Stellaris I was experiencing it already in early mid-game. Not a good sign.\nI kept building new ships for my fleet, waiting for an opportunity to pounce on a neighbour, and eventually I got one when the borders with a neighbouring empire shifted for unexplained reasons. This war was also frustrating, but this time because time was ticking so slowly. And also because I lost a big battle I was sure I'd win, where my fleet was on paper more powerful, and my 5-star admiral faced off against their 2-star admiral.\nThat's where I shut down the game yesterday, and I've yet to decide if I'm going to continue it or not.\nSo what else is new in the DLC:\nTraditions (suspiciously similar to social policies in Civilization V) and factions (a bit like those in Crusader Kings II), which together add a bit more personality to your civilisation, both good additions, although I mostly forgot about the existence of factions while playing. And a story line that I didn't get to finish and hence don't really have an opinion on.\nOther stuff, big and small:\nPlanets don't move around their stars. This bothers me more than it probably should. I searched the Workshop for mods that make planets move, but found none.\nI have mixed feelings about research and how the tech tree works. I like that you can research enemies' technology by analysing the debris from battles. I wish there were more consequences to our choices though, and I'd like to see the game steer the various empires into different directions tech-wise.\nShips are too easy to upgrade. I like how in Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron I end up with fleets that are a mix of outdated and modern ships, but in Stellaris you can upgrade them all with the click of a button.\nSector AI is dumb. I eventually found myself with a huge surplus of food and a shortage of energy.\nSectors overall are very boring. I wish they would build fleets of their own like vassals do. They're even worse than colonial nations in Europa Universalis IV.\nVerdict:\nPoor performance, still kinda dull. Which is a shame, because I still think this game has a lot of potential. Here's hoping the next DLC adds espionage.",

I believe that they are a good addition to the game since it allows for an extended amount of strategy and flavor to each playstyle, but the execution of them was incorrect.\nHonor update also seems like a nice change, since it rewards honorable players. Currently we have experienced a lot of \"punish bad guys\" but very little \"reward good guys\". This change might heavily influence the players behaviour.\nVoice chat doesn't bother me.

Named \"Thunderbird\" and \"Raindancer\", they paint her face in red and white and remove her Eye of Horus tattoo. Her hair is separated into two braids and her armour bears distinct \"tribal\" patterns. Her helmet is a falcon decorated with grass. Dozens of forum posts questioned, Did Blizzard just assume Pharah could switch races because she's brown?\"*\n#NerdAlert",

Through text communication things get so much lighter, it's easier for me to speak up but also easier to receive the message. If it's any negative I will always just get around it as if it is \"only text\". With voice communication such things will be come more complex.\nHowever the addition of voice communication could also decrease the toxicity since you get more contact with the human and is more reluctant towards spewing negativity. Also I would love to be able to have proper communication with my teammates, since as a support main, it gets quite complex to \"make your team win\" without it.\nAs conclusion: I actually look forward in certain perspectives towards having a voice chat and could actually see it work.\nThough I believe that I will find myself in situation where I will not speak due to my family's noises. Oh well, keep to Discord and my duo partner.",

    "content": "Article:\nhttp://gizmodo.com/no-one-a...\nhttps://www.currentaffairs.org/2017...\nThe biggest Hillary Clinton fanboy on the internet\u2014Peter Daou\u2014created a website for other like-minded worshipers of Hillary Clinton called \"Verrit.\" The website aims to supply Hillary supporters with Verrit-approved facts and statistics, but a lot of its content thus far has been quotes from corporate Democrats, attacks on progressives, and self-fellating posts about the good-heartedness of Hillary and her supporters. Verrit was destined to fade into obscurity with nobody knowing about its existence until Hillary Clinton tweeted out her support for the website\u2014propelling it into the spotlight\u2014where various journalists ripped it to shreds. Backlash against Verrit prompted Peter Daou to have a meltdown over Twitter where he inexplicably attacked progressive shows like Chapo Trap House and The Young Turks. Unfortunately for Daou, however, Verrit will probably fail and be remembered as nothing more than a shitty website that was turned into an internet almost immediately. Too bad.\n#TheHumanistReport",

    "votes": 9,
    "content": "Poland's historical claims to Germany have been covered a lot recently.\nJust a reminder, Poland demands reparations from Germany for the massive losses inflicted on Poland during World War II. Now, every man and his dog talks about it in Poland. For instance, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, announced that Poland had never refused Germany's World War II compensation, and so, it wished to receive a full amount of money. Then the discussion was supported by the Minister of National Defence for Poland, Antoni Macierewicz, who said there was legal groundwork for Poland to demand reparations from the Federal Republic of Germany. He also stressed that it was the decision of the Polish People's Republic, not currently independent Republic of Poland to drop the reparations. The head of Polish government, Beata Szydlo, has been of the same opinion. She considers it is time to restore justice. 'Poland is only asking for justice. It could be said that Poland is demanding justice. We are a victim of World War II and the damage was not reimbursed in any way', she said.\nAnd yet they consider that the amount of compensation can be estimated in the millions of euros.\nAnd what did Germany make of all of that?\nGermany's government clearly stated that the issue of reparations for damages Poland suffered during World War II had been settled politically and legally, and so it's considered to be closed. 'You can read about it in transcripts of the 2 August government briefing where this question was last raised,' said a representative of the Press Service. Furthermore, the German side stressed that in the early 1990s Warsaw received reparations from Germany in the form of tranches of 500 million deutschemarks, as well as, nearly 2 billion deutschemarks for Polish slave laborers, victims of Nazi horrible experiments and Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivors. Would Poland challenge the position of Germany and continue to shake it down? We'll found out soon enough. But certainly, payment alone is not enough for Poland. For instance, earlier it has become known that the ruling PiS Party is preparing a draft law on receiving war reparations from Russia, too. It has been initiative of a PiS MP, Stanislaw Pieta, who said that Warsaw should recover even more compensation payments from Moscow, namely, 'trillions of zlotys for USSR crimes'. He was supported by such member of Sejm as Malgorzata Gosiewska, who considered that 'Russians pillaged Polish industrial enterprises and stole works of art'. But the head of the Polish MFA, Witold Waszczykowski, has topped them all. He said that the Soviet Union together with Germany 'has contributed mightily' to the outbreak of the Second World War.\nRussia did not take long to react to it. A Deputy Chairman of the State Duma, Irina Yarovaya, responded to Waszczykowski's allegations. She said, 'The chief of the Polish diplomatic service ended up with his tortuous cynicism in positions of the Third Reich ideologue, Joseph Goebbels, 'The bigger the lie, the more people will believe it'.\nHowever, they never fail to remind Poland that in 1945 the Potsdam Conference adopted an agreement under which Poland received reparations from the share of the USSR that came from the eastern zone of Germany. But a few years later, the USSR and the Polish People's Republic completed an agreement which put an end to reparation payments from the German Democratic Republic, starting from 1954.\nSuch imprudent and absolutely unlawful behavior of Poles may easily spread to Ukraine. This is because Warsaw has repeatedly raised its claims against Kiev. In addition to the restitution of lands or payment of compensation for them to those Polish citizens whose ancestry owned the lands before Galicia's integration into the USSR, Poland's authorities lay claim to lands of Western Ukraine which is believed to be illegally annexed from Poland in 1939. The Polish Senator, Prof. Jan Zaryn said, 'Without Lviv \u2013 the city that always held true to Poland \u2013 there would be no the Polish people'. We would be lying if we say that it will be enough for Poland to get only Lviv. Warsaw needs the whole of Galicia and Volyn, which is Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Volyn and Rivne provinces of Ukraine. While until recently their claims have not moved beyond words, then now there are serious reasons to be concerned. And further actions of Poland towards Ukraine will be heavily dependent on European and US reaction to the Polish claims against Germany. If international organizations and courts do not reject these claims, it will create a serious precedent, which may have irreversible consequences in future.\nAlthough, many of experts calm down the public, identifying the Polish statements just as an attempt to get attention from the EU, namely, such EU main member as Germany.",

    "content": "\"Four members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Islam living in Detroit, Michigan have recently been indicted on charges of female genital mutilation (FGM). This is the first time the US government has prosecuted an \u201cFGM\u201d case since a federal law was passed in 1996. (...)\nInitial, albeit conflicting reports suggest that the Dawoodi Bohra engage in [... a ...] limited form of female genital cutting \u2013 not the more extreme forms that are often highlighted in the Western media. This fact alone will make things rather complicated for the prosecution. The defense team has already signaled that it will emphasize the \u201clow-risk\u201d aspect of the alleged cutting, claiming that it shouldn\u2019t really count as mutilation. It is, after all, far less invasive than Jewish ritual male circumcision, which is legally allowed on minors in the US, no questions asked.\nBased on this discrepancy, if attorneys for the Bohra can show a gendered or religious double standard in existing law, the ramifications will be not be small. Either male circumcision will have to be restricted in some way, or \u201cminor\u201d forms of FGM permitted.",

    "votes": 9,
    "content": "The news that North Korea may have bought powerful rocket engines from a Ukrainian factory shocked the entire world. Cooperation with North Korea is not characteristic of Ukrainian especially after the Maidan revolution. Still there's nothing to be surprised at. Nothing has changed in Ukraine since it became independent 25 years ago. The values the Ukrainian people stood up for in 2014 have failed to take roots in the country so far.\nCorruption, anarchy, and repressions against its own citizens \u2013 this is the reality in the present day Ukraine. The country has gained a scandalous reputation since the time it started asserting itself on the international political arena. There are attacks on gay parades in Kiev, attempts to limit freedom of speech and movements of European politicians by introducing the so-called 'black lists'. Add here the endless dispute with Poland over the Kiev's effort to portray as heroes the Volhynia massacre participants, and the radiation threat to Europe due to numerous accidents on the outdated Ukrainian nuclear power plants. This is how the world sees Ukraine now.\nThe Ukrainian authorities in their reaction to the scandal over ballistic missile engines came up with their habitual accusations against Russia. Everything is quite logical and predictable. Deputy minister of information policy of Ukraine Zolotukhin has released recommendations for the mass media on what they are allowed to do and what they should focus on in news coverage of the leakage from the strategically important facility into the unfriendly state.\nThe Ministry of Information Policy of Ukraine (hereinafter - the Ministry) taking into consideration the recently appeared accusations of Ukraine in cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is addressing TV channels and Internet mass media with the following.\nIt is requested that in news coverage of this incident the explanation of the emerged misconception should be based on three basic points:\nUkraine opposes the North Korea nuclear program and is wholly supportive of the sanctions against the country;\nUkrainian officials have never been on any cooperation terms aimed at technology exchanges with North Korea or trading rocket engines with it;\nthe original American mass media articles on \"Ukrainian engines\" in North Korea had been ordered by Russian secret services and the foes of Ukraine.\nWith the scandal already having found international resonance and being in progress due to independent reasons, the Ministry believes it appropriate to concentrate the mass media attention on the defense of the international image of the Ukrainian state power structures by disclosing real data on outer forces' involvement into the work of the PA Yuzhmash. It's to be noted in mass media relevant publications that the plant is located in the city of Dnipro abundant with the supporters of the DPR and LPR terrorist groupings. Among the plant's personnel there are numerous so called \"Soviet mold\" staffers who could have made copies of documents and got into private talks with the North Korea representatives just on their own, due to their political or profiteering motives. Moreover, foreign intelligence services' moles could have been planted into Yuzhnoe Design Bureau so that to trade in technologies with the aim of subsequent discretization of Ukraine. Mass media should cite the SBU sources and make it known for wide public and foreign journalists that Ukrainian secret services and law-enforcement agencies are applying vigorous effort to restore order at the PA Yuzhmash. In particular, they are engaged in conducting interrogations, ransacking offices, and exempting documents with the aim of revealing the active spying network.\nThe ministry actively recommends that mass media outlets should consistently mention in their reports that Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Ukroboronprom have nothing to do with the ballistic missile launches in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The row over \"the Ukrainian engines\" has once again testified to the existence of the threats from the puppet regime of the occupied territories and to the activity of the numerous supporters of separatists in Dnipropetrovsk region prompting the need of the PA Yuzhmash being moved to the area maximally distanced from the ATO zone.\nThe results of this letter consideration are requested to be delivered to the Ministry in a written or electronic form up till August 17, 2017.\nDeputy Minister\nD. Zolotukhin\nIn fact, Ukrainian mass media have gotten the instruction from above to fabricate data and artificially mold public opinion in the prescribed direction. In particular, all the links with North Korea are to be denied, and all the initial news released by the American tabloids should be declared the planted ones. The Ukrainian ministry is set to put the responsibility on the shoulders of the Yuzhmash staffers having \"Soviet background\" and some would-be foreign agents. Also, numerous episodes with interrogations, searches and document exemptions aimed at exposing a whole spying cell, are being mentioned.\nAll these things don't amount to any defense of the state international image. It looks more like a la Stalin reprisals and direct violation of press and speech freedoms in Ukraine. The authorities are least inclined to conduct any objective investigation. They aren't set to apply measures with the aim of changing rules of working with secret documents, boosting security at the plant, or inviting international experts and observers. These are just usual steps that any civilized state would make in similar circumstances. Instead Kiev came out with the directive on the informational manipulation with facts to adjust the fakes to inner and outer political environment, foreign mass media being in the know about it.\nWhat is real is that, willingly or not, the treaty on nuclear non-proliferation has been violated and the grave threat to global security has emerged. But Ukrainian authorities are again turning things inside out, putting stake not on finding solution of the problem but rather on making a grandstand play for the international community. It is pure formalism and lack of flexibility. Further development of Ukraine is hampered by this exactly approach once again and this is also the reason why Ukraine, still not a part of the EU, has got to make rather a long way yet to reach this \"great purpose\".",

    "votes": 9,
    "content": "In his interview with Bild Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy Angelino Alfano said that Europe had abandoned Italy on the refugee crisis. Yet he refused to criticize the \"open-door\" policy, declared by Angela Merkel in 2015.\nMEPs from Italy sitting on the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs put it more clearly and sharply in their open letter to the Chancellor of Germany.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9fmrn5m.jpg\nThe letter explicitly stated that Germany failed to honor the obligations it had assumed back in 2015 to provide additional finding for migrants and exceed the established quotas of accepting refugees. The MEPs have demanded that Germany pay financial compensation for it.\nBy opening the EU doors Merkel has not only made profuse promises aiming to involve the whole EU in this process, by hook or by crook, but also roped her own people in without any consultations with them. No one in Germany has ever heard they should host refugees in excess of the quotas let alone cover the expenses of neighboring countries.\nBut these stories are not made up of nothing. As far back as a year ago, despaired of ever receiving the promised assistance from Germany, Italy demanded that the immigration policy be financed with Eurobonds. Merkel rejected the idea then. Germany's Federal Minister of the Interior Thomas de Maiziere only adds fuel to the flame. One day he accuses Italian authorities of sending migrants to the north, another day he blames them for deliberate human trafficking by sea. At the same time, human rights activists also put pressure on Italy demanding that its ports stay open and protesting against repatriation of the refugees, who failed to undergo the special control.\nAnd so it should come as no surprise that Italian officials have started to resent it and openly blackmail Germany by threatening time and again to 'issue provisional permits for all arriving refugees enabling them to move freely within the EU'.\nNow, that the European Court of Justice has rejected the 'open-door' policy, quite a few questions remain unanswered. For instance, there is one to Mrs. Merkel. Who in Germany is going to pay compensation to Italy, if the EU court finds its claims legal? And it would be quite interesting to ask the Germans whether they are happy with the leader who plays around with their EU neighbors and disgraces the entire nation? One unsuccessful PR stunt of Germany's Chancellor can cost millions of euros and lead to the breakup of the European Union.",

They keep a watchful eye over political opponents.\nThe authorities of Mexico for example are intensely applying Pegasus for intimidation and subsequent punishment of public activists, journalists, members of various groups that oppose torture, assassinations and corruption. Hundreds of people critical of the Mexico government are annually detained with the help of the NSO Group software. Those people often become victims of criminal groups or just disappear into nowhere.\nPegasus software installed on smartphones enabled the Mexican authorities to find out that about 80 students from a teacher training college on three buses were coming to Iguala so as to join protest actions on 26 September 2014. Police intercepted the buses on the way to the city by opening fire. Four students were shot dead on the spot, 43 more were arrested while the rest were lucky to escape. The day after this accident the relatives of the detained students turned to the police to get some information on where the detainees were held. The police said they had no clue about any detentions. Later the authorities declared that all 43 missing people had been killed by members of the Guerreros Unidos group. It's worth noting that attorney Mario Patron, who along with the Human Rights Center filed claims against the authorities after the students had disappeared, became the owner of the surveillance software on his cellphone as well.\nAre those multimillion sums to meet the needs of the Ukrainian technical intelligence make any sense or not? This question, alongside with some ethical and legal aspects, remains unclear so far. It's impossible to forecast now the real effect to the national economy of those costs or whether they are going to be ever compensated by western partners of Ukraine. We can only hope for those highly expensive measures, that appear to relate not only to Lviv region actually, to become a really effective tool to provide security, not blackmailing or repressions.",

The country is also establishing an Army reserve unit in Yellowknife and has started construction of an Arctic submarine base:\nin 2009 Norway moved its Operational Command Headquarters from Stavanger into Reitan, thus becoming the first country with its central military command located in the Arctic. The major combat formation, Northern Brigade, equipped with armored vehicles, has been deployed in the Norwegian Near Arctic region;\nin 2013 president Obama approved the National Strategy for the Arctic Region proclaiming the Washington's right for unilateral action aimed at defending its 'vital interests';\nin 2015 in the Arctic parts of Sweden, Norway and Finland the massive maneuvers Arctic Challenge Exercises-2015 took place. More than 100 military jets and over 4 thousand soldiers from six NATO countries (Norway, Great Britain, Germany, the USA, France, and the Netherlands), as well as from formally neutral Switzerland, Sweden and Finland, were involved. In naval activities 50 warships representing 17 countries were engaged.\nIt can't be called other than a full-fledged preparation of the future military expansion to be followed by the share-out of the Arctic resource pie.",

Both the Democrats and Republicans took part in developing the new restrictive measures. The Congress unanimously supported the bill and Trump approved it with his signature.\nIt is a known fact that President Trump is on bad terms with Congress owing to his willingness to breathe new life into the US-Russia relations, yet the sanctions were just as inevitable as Trump's signature on the bill regardless of his personal disapproval of it. All media sources widely covered this news. However, it is very hard to understand why all mainstream media ignored the participation of third parties in drafting the new sanctions. In this case we are speaking about the visit of Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko to Washington and his unofficial negotiations there. Breitbart News presented its own investigation.\nMany take a dim view of Breitbart, but Poroshenko's words in his official Twitter about some agreements he achieved during his Washington trip should, at least, put the global media on the alert. In this case Breitbart News was the only agency that looked into the issue and presented its inquiry unlike the mainstream media which displayed their bias once again.",

Black Americans perceive -- and experience -- racial discrimination more than white Americans.\nThe bottom line is that nonwhites tend to see racial discrimination a lot more than whites do.

Why? Because Senate Democrats that don't cosponsor Bernie's bill will be exposed as shills for the health insurance industry. Their biggest concern, however, is that this bill will become a litmus test, and their unwillingness to support it will ultimately lead to them facing primary opponents in upcoming elections. They're right. If they don't back his bill, they will be primaried by progressives and kicked out of office. Progressives are not fucking around.\nThe Humanist Report",

    "title": "Ignore The Crazy Man In The White House, Government Tells North Korea",
    "votes": 22,
    "content": "Article:\nhttp://nymag.com/daily...\nEarlier this week, as I'm sure most people understand, Donald Trump made the comment that \"North Korea best not make any more threats against the United States, or they're going to be met with a fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" That particular statement was not run by Donald Trump's advisers. He did not speak with any of his military personnel before he made that statement. And now, those advisers, the people within the military, his national security advisers, they're pretty upset at the President for coming forth with that statement, and they have now had to come out with statements of their own, basically undermining what the President of The United States did.\nBoth Rex Tillerson and James Mattis have both made public statements essentially saying that we're not that worried about North Korea, we do not see this as a massive threat against The United States, everybody needs to just relax for the moment. And the underlying message is, \"please disregard the previous message by our unstable President of The United States.\" That's what these men are doing right now. It's not about calming the public in case there's a crisis. It's about trying to distance the policy of the President from the actual policy of the government. In fact, they have come out and said that the President's statement does not reflect the policy within the White House with regards to North Korea. The day Donald Trump made that statement, earlier in that morning, he had been told by his security advisers that North Korea does not pose any immediate threat to The United States, and that was when they already knew that they had miniaturized these warheads and were able to put them on bombs. They weren't all that concerned about it, considering the fact, one, we don't even know if North Korea has the technology to do that, two, we really don't know if their missiles are even capable of taking off. We've seen plenty of failed tests in the last year, and three, if the missiles take off and if they carry a warhead, are they even capable of making it to The United States.\nThese generals, these advisers, the Secretary of State, they have all had to come out and tell the public, \"We're very sorry\" basically, \"That our President is such a hothead, but trust us, at the end of the day he's not really calling the shots, we're not going to let anything bad happen. We're not going to let him do anything too stupid that's going to destroy not only parts of The United States, but parts of the rest of the world, and destroy the US's image all over the planet.\" So I guess we can take them at their word, personally I don't put a whole hell of a lot of trust into Rex Tillerson or Mattis, but at least they understand that situations like this have to be approached with a little bit of poise, a little bit of diplomacy, and a lot less of Donald Trump's hotheadedness, where he's willing to start a nuclear war with someone just to prove a point.\n#RingOfFire",

    "title": "The Practice of Ritual Defamation",
    "votes": -9,
    "content": "How values, opinions and beliefs are controlled in democratic societies.\nDefamation is the destruction or attempted destruction of the reputation, status, character or standing in the community of a person or group of persons by unfair, wrongful, or malicious speech or publication. For the purposes of this essay, the central element is defamation in retaliation for the real or imagined attitudes, opinions or beliefs of the victim, with the intention of silencing or neutralizing his or her influence, and/or making an example of them so as to discourage similar independence and \"insensitivity\" or non-observance of taboos. It is different in nature and degree from simple criticism or disagreement in that it is aggressive, organized and skillfully applied, often by an organization or representative of a special interest group, and in that it consists of several characteristic elements.\nRitual Defamation is not ritualistic because it follows any prescribed religious or mystical doctrine, nor is it embraced in any particular document or scripture. Rather, it is ritualistic because it follows a predictable, stereotyped pattern which embraces a number of elements, as in a ritual.\nThe elements of a Ritual Defamation are these:\nIn a ritual defamation the victim must have violated a particular taboo in some way, usually by expressing or identifying with a forbidden attitude, opinion or belief. It is not necessary that he \"do\" anything about it or undertake any particular course of action, only that he engage in some form of communication or expression.\nThe method of attack in a ritual defamation is to assail the character of the victim, and never to offer more than a perfunctory challenge to the particular attitudes, opinions or beliefs expressed or implied. Character assassination is its primary tool.\nAn important rule in ritual defamation is to avoid engaging in any kind of debate over the truthfulness or reasonableness of what has been expressed, only condemn it. To debate opens the issue up for examination and discussion of its merits, and to consider the evidence that may support it, which is just what the ritual defamer is trying to avoid. The primary goal of a ritual defamation is censorship and repression.\nThe victim is often somebody in the public eye - someone who is vulnerable to public opinion - although perhaps in a very modest way. It could be a schoolteacher, writer, businessman, minor official, or merely an outspoken citizen. Visibility enhances vulnerability to ritual defamation.\nAn attempt, often successful, is made to involve others in the defamation. In the case of a public official, other public officials will be urged to denounce the offender. In the case of a student, other students will be called upon, and so on.\nIn order for a ritual defamation to be effective, the victim must be dehumanized to the extent that he becomes identical with the offending attitude, opinion or belief, and in a manner which distorts it to the point where it appears at its most extreme. For example, a victim who is defamed as a \"subversive\" will be identified with the worst images of subversion, such as espionage, terrorism or treason. A victim defamed as a \"pervert\" will be identified with the worst images of perversion, including child molestation and rape. A victim defamed as a \"racist\" or \"anti-Semitic\" will be identified with the worst images of racism or anti-Semitism, such as lynchings or gas chambers.\nAlso to be successful, a ritual defamation must bring pressure and humiliation on the victim from every quarter, including family and friends. If the victim has school children, they may be taunted and ridiculed as a consequence of adverse publicity. If they are employed, they may be fired from their job. If the victim belongs to clubs or associations, other members may be urged to expel them.\nAny explanation the victim may offer, including the claim of being misunderstood, is considered irrelevant. To claim truth as a defence for a politically incorrect value, opinion or belief is interpreted as defiance and only compounds the problem. Ritual defamation is often not necessarily an issue of being wrong or incorrect but rather of \"insensitivity\" and failing to observe social taboos.\nAn interesting aspect of ritual defamation as a practice is its universality. It is not specific to any value, opinion or belief or to any group or subculture. It may be used for or against any political, ethnic, national or religious group. It may, for example, by anti-Semites against Jews, or by Jews against anti-Semites; by rightists against leftists or by leftists against rightists, and so on.\nThe power of ritual defamation lies entirely in its capacity to intimidate and terrorize. It embraces some elements of primitive superstitious belief, as in a \"curse\" or \"hex.\" It plays into the subconscious fear most people have of being abandoned or rejected by the tribe or by society and being cut off from social and psychological support systems.\nThe weakness of ritual defamation lies in its tendency toward overkill and in its obvious maliciousness. Occasionally a ritual defamation will fail because of poor planning and failure to correctly judge the vulnerability of the victim or because its viciousness inadvertently generates sympathy.\nIt\u2019s important to recognize and identify the patterns of a ritual defamation. Like all propaganda and disinformation campaigns it is accomplished primarily through the manipulation of words and symbols. It is not used to persuade, but to punish. Although it may have cognitive elements, its thrust is primarily emotional. Ritual Defamation is used to hurt, to intimidate, to destroy, and to persecute, and to avoid the dialogue, debate and discussion upon which a free society depends. On those grounds it must be opposed no matter who tries to justify its use.",

    "title": "[VI] Is Merkel going to win the federal elections owing to Poroshenko?",
    "votes": 9,
    "content": "Every time shortly before the elections there are heated debates over the funding of parties. The Bundestag, by all means, issues some data but it mainly deals with the contributions making the sum of more than 10 thousand euros. The sources of other 69% donations below this minimal level remain unknown. It's a well-established fact already that during election campaigns the CDU/CSU has always had incontestable financial advantage making it a winner at the elections in the long run. Where does Merkel turn to in search of the money able to lead her to victory?\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fA3SquZ.jpg\nIt's secret to nobody that CDU hides its \"black cash\" in the foundations having accounts in the banks of Switzerland. It was the usual practice in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Do you remember that 1999 scandal that forced Helmut Kohl to retire? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki... Nothing has changed since then. So far, CDU has been sticking to the old tradition of concealing the party incomings.\nMichael Langer, a staffer of the magazine Bl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr deutsche und internationale Politik, managed to clear up the scheme of unlawful financing of Angela Merkel's election campaign. The illegal financial flows from the Chancellor's friends are accumulated in Albertina foundation with its account in Rothschild Bank AG. The foundation is supervised by a famous financier Herbert Batliner who has been acting on behalf of the CDU over dozens of years already.\nOddly enough, the name of Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine, is also in the list of Bundeskanzlerin's sponsors. Perhaps it doesn't amount to a full-fledged sensation, for Poroshenko by making donations into the CDU/CSU coffers is actually interested in guarantees for his present and future business in Germany. As you might know, back in 2011, Poroshenko bought a starch producing facility in Saxony-Anhalt and registered it under his ownership via some dummy firms. Such a scheme gives Ukrainian president a good chance to launder the illegal profits. Poroshenko, as well as other Merkel's sponsors, transfers \"clean\" money to Albertina foundation and then by small sums the donations \"are channeled for financial backing of the local and central CDU branches, their election activity\".\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AhlWT5z.jpg\nTranslation.\nMerkel and Poroshenko are not only on friendly terms, financial ones as well\nPre-election campaign comes very costly indeed. Parties spend millions euros to reach their goals. Financial backing of parties is highly questionable, for the process isn't always transparent despite the existing rather tough laws. Bundestag election campaign of 2017 is no exclusion. In particular, there are quite serious claims to Chancellor Merkel and CDU party. They relate funding of Merkel's election campaign by president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko.\nPoroshenko's offshore schemes in Federal Republic of Germany.\nAs it has become known from the 'Panama papers', many top politicians have their faces in the trough. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, who had promised to stop doing business over the span of his presidential term, is also in the list. Yes, he has partially reconstructed his business and transferred some active assets to 'blind trust' management but several enterprises are still staying under his personal rule and control.\nPoroshenko's business pattern is rather sophisticated, comprising both large and small facilities. One of them is a plant for production of starch, fodder and gluten in German city of Elsteraue. Poroshenko purchased it in 2011. This enterprise is an integral part of Poroshenko's business system, for in Ukraine he has got a number of processing companies and a large agricultural company producing raw materials. Apart from that, starch is used at candy enterprises owned by Poroshenko. The purchase of the plant in Germany made it possible for the Ukrainian president to become the biggest starch and molasses producer in Europe.\nThere was employed special scheme with some offshore firms involved to cover the participation of Poroshenko in the purchasing deal and getting the plant into his ownership. According to the Register of Enterprises in Germany, the operator of the plant, Interstarch GmbH, owes its birth to the Cyprus company Camarin Limited. Up till 2014 the founder of this company had been the British Morewig Limited. Later on, the Cyprus company was reregistered for a firm from the British Virgin Islands.\nFinally, the plant in Elsteraue came into possession of Euro Business Investments LTD registered on the offshore island of Tortola. The consultant role during the purchase of the German plant in 2011 was performed by Investment Capital Ukraine (ICU). According to its data, the beneficiary owner of the Cyprus company is a close friend of Poroshenko and his business-partner Sergey Zaitsev. But, like in the story with the offshore reregistration of Roshen corporation, Zaitsev is only performing the role of a frontman, while the real owner receiving multimillion profits is actually president of Ukraine Poroshenko, according to the 'Panama papers'.\nScandal around donations. History repeats itself.\nDuring his meeting with Angela Merkel, Petro Poroshenko declared, 'We need a strong Germany in the united Europe'. And who can guarantee this? It's naturally Bundeskanzlerin and a close friend Angela Merkel. Poroshenko is personally interested in her victory at the elections, for she is the true guarantor of his business unhampered progress in Germany and Europe.\nElections into Landtag of the North Rhine-Westphalia are usually called the full rehearsal before the Bundestag elections. Victory at the Landtag elections means victory at the Bundestag elections. The North Rhine-Westphalia has always been 'red' and CDU victory became a real sensation. How on earth could Merkel manage to score off her rivals? Money talks, not everywhere of course....but in many areas, you know.... In particular it is quite able to ensure success at the elections. The sponsorship is still far from being transparent. The accounts regularly issued by Bundestag refer to a minor part of donations while more than 69% of them are of unknown origin due to the fact that the sums donated do not exceed 10 thousand euros.\nInformation on the actual sums spent by CDU on the elections in the North Rhine-Westphalia is still being concealed from public though the 'shadow' funding scheme has come to the broad daylight already.\nHerbert Batliner, a famous lawyer and a trustee from Lichtenstein, is running more than 10 thousand various foundations. About a hundred of them (Norfolk, Wisotest, Aspe, etc.) were founded by him on the CDU request with the aim of concealing the party revenues. They had to liquidate part of the funds following their disclosure. The rest of them have been successfully functioning up till now, Albertina in particular. This foundation, having its banking account in Rothschild Bank AG, has been over 10 years employed as a gigantic 'washing machine' for money laundry. The money laundered at the Poroshenko's plant in Elsteraue arrives here as well. 'Clean' money of the Ukrainian president and other donators by small sums is then channeled for financial backing of the local and central CDU branches, their election activity.\nMerkel is aware of the fraud.\nIs Merkel in the know about who and how financed Armin Laschet (the head of North Rhine-Westphalia)? This is rather a rhetorical type of question in the context. Angela Merkel, whom former Chancellor Helmut Kohl would call 'mein M\u00e4dchen', picked up lots of useful things with her tutor, including the practice of concealing party revenues. The CDU is widely known for its old standing tradition of harboring illegal profits in Switzerland.\nGerman voters are to make rather a sophisticated choice at the September elections due to those new revelations. Still they must make the right decision so that not to allow far more dramatic change of situation to occur in Germany and Europe as a whole.\nCould we ever have thought that \"Mommy of the German nation\" can plunge that low! It appears that after the grandiose collapse of multiculturalism policy and refugee havoc she is not sure of her own might and doesn't believe that Germans trust her the way they did it 12 years ago.\nOriginal article in German. http://www.hamburger-wochenblatt.de/rahlsted...",

She wrote to her Sisters, \"To the good God nothing is little, because He is so great and we so small\u2014that is why He stoops down and takes the trouble to make those little things for us\u2014to give us a chance to prove our love for Him. He makes them; they are very great. He cannot make anything small; they are infinite. Yes my dear children, be faithful in the little practices of love, of little sacrifices\u2014of the little interior mortification\u2014of the little fidelities to Rule, which will build you in the life of holiness\u2014make you Christ-like.\" (Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light, By Mother Teresa, Brian Kolodiejchuk)",

According to the Baltimore County Police Department, officers sought to serve Gaines a warrant in relation to an earlier traffic violation. Upon entering her apartment, an hours-long standoff ensued. At least one of the officers shot Gaines, killing her and wounding Gaines\u2019 five-year-old son. Portions of the standoff were filmed by Gaines and posted to social-media networking sites; however, upon police request, Facebook deactivated Gaines\u2019 Facebook and Instagram accounts (which we later restored after her death).\nThis piece was to created to honour her as a Black woman, as a mother, and as a human being. It stands in solidarity, as she did, with the #BlackLivesMatter and Black Liberation movements.\nAll profits from the sale of this piece as either a poster or canvas are donated directly to the family of Korryn Gaines, and every purchase also gets a receipt of the donation made as well.\"",

Exhausting. Unsurprisingly, science fiction writers, movie directors, and prop-makers also love space suits \u2014 you\u2019ll find them everywhere from Robert A. Heinlein\u2019s novel Have Space Suit \u2014 Will Travel, to the latest Alien movie. But not everybody does their homework: for every fictional space suit that\u2019s more than just a fancy costume, there\u2019s one that\u2019s impractical and nonsensical even in a fictional world.\nThere\u2019s no such thing as an \u201cideal\u201d space suit, because you need specific features for different environments. But we can answer a few basic questions. Is a fictional space suit safe and wearable for its characters? Does it perform its task well? And does it realistically look like it could perform that task? With that in mind, here are some of the greatest and most cringeworthy depictions, arranged from worst to best.",

In June of 1978, he was 26 years old and was working for Atari as a programmer of games for their VCS console, which was modestly successful at the time but still over a year removed from the massive popularity that would follow. More due to the novelty of the medium and upper management\u2019s disinterest in the process of making games than any spirit of creative idealism, Atari at the time operated on the auteur model of videogame development. Programmers like Robinett were not only expected also to fill the role of designers \u2014 a role that had yet to be clearly defined anywhere as distinct from programming \u2014 but to function as their own artists and writers. To go along with this complete responsibility, they were given complete control of every aspect of their games, including the opportunity to decide what sorts of games to make in the first place. On Robinett\u2019s first day of work, according to his own account, his new boss Larry Kaplan had told him, \u201cYour job is to design games. Now go design one.\u201d",

We know this they have in fact done that -- and more. Here are a bunch of wildly different movies you didn't know are based on the exact same people:",

    "content": "This piece was originally meant as a gift for a good friend and family member, but I wanted to share it with you.\nI was going to buy an Obama Poster, but although I like Shepard Fairey's version (you've seen it, trust me), the eyebrows seemed a bit too dark and the jaw too wide. It bugged me enough to make my own. And I knew if I was going to stand up to Shepard Fairey, I was going to have to a dang good job.\nShepard's influences are similar to my own (graffiti + skate + propaganda), but Shepard's work has a much darker feel.\nI began by sketching out the highlights and shadows like I usually do. Often, in order to bring the gender differences to the forefront, I'll draw females and males differently. Males frequently have straighter, angular lines, and females will have smooth curves. I spent nearly two months on this piece off and on (in between a lot of other projects), and let the my mood guide me a whole lot more. Combining smooth and straight lines had an interesting effect, making a much more painterly feel.\nThe result is a piece that is much more layered and complicated than my usual work, and the muted tones allow me to pull out variations in his skin that Shepard wasn't able to achieve because of his 4-colour palette.",

In 1982, Shepard met the actor Jessica Lange on the set of the film Frances, in which he had a supporting role.

They married in 1958 in Washington DC, however when they moved back to their home town of Central Point, Virginia, their home was raided by the police.\nAfter appealing to Attorney General Robert Kennedy and the American Civil Liberties Union, the case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, and on June 12th, 1967 the unanimous decision was reached that the Commonwealth of Virginia's argument that a law forbidding both white and black persons from marrying persons of another race violated both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nDespite the Supreme Court's decision, anti-miscegenation laws remained on the books in several states, although the decision had made them unenforceable. In 2000, Alabama became the last state to adapt its laws to the Supreme Court's decision, by removing a provision prohibiting mixed-race marriage from its state constitution through a ballot initiative. 60% of voters voted for the removal of the anti-miscegenation rule, and 40% against.\nAfter Loving v. Virginia, the number of interracial marriages continued to increase across the United States and in the South.\nLoving Day has been celebrated annually on June 12th since 2004 by people of mixed race and people in mixed relationships.\nThe original artwork was commissioned by my friend Heidi Durrow for the 2014 Mixed Experience Heritage Month.",

    "content": "\"Morality is Temporary, Wisdom is Permanent.\"\nThe quote lies in a book called Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-Crossed Child In the Final Days of the American Century, penned by Thompson and published in 2003. The quote was in a response to a story he tells about how when he was 9, he and his friends tipped over a mailbox in front of a bus (the driver of which was especially cruel to him and his friends). Tampering with mail, of course, is a federal offense, and it brought two Federal Agents to his door. They began questioning him, accusing him of the deed, and saying that all his friends had ratted on him. However, he had the gall to question them on this, and when they weren't able to prove they had gotten any confessions or witnesses, they left.\nThis piece replaces the now-unavailable Lois McMaster Bujold piece that was originally part of the 20 initial Who Said What pieces. It was later discovered that the Bujold quote was misattributed, and all copies were destroyed.\nA timelapse video showing the creation of this piece can be seen here: https://youtu.be/Y0XvFZ6l...",

    "content": "Mildred and Richard Loving are best known for having gone against the anti-miscegenation laws in Virginia. They married in 1958 in Washington DC, however when they moved back to their home town of Central Point, Virginia, their home was raided by the police.\nAfter appealing to Attorney General Robert Kennedy and the American Civil Liberties Union, the case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, and on June 12th, 1967 the unanimous decision was reached that the Commonwealth of Virginia's argument that a law forbidding both white and black persons from marrying persons of another race violated both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nDespite the Supreme Court's decision, anti-miscegenation laws remained on the books in several states, although the decision had made them unenforceable. In 2000, Alabama became the last state to adapt its laws to the Supreme Court's decision, by removing a provision prohibiting mixed-race marriage from its state constitution through a ballot initiative. 60% of voters voted for the removal of the anti-miscegenation rule, and 40% against.\nAfter Loving v. Virginia, the number of interracial marriages continued to increase across the United States and in the South.\nLoving Day has been celebrated annually on June 12th since 2004 by people of mixed race and people in mixed relationships.\nThe original artwork was commissioned by my friend Heidi Durrow for the 2014 Mixed Experience Heritage Month.",

It is located in the Borghese Gardens on the Pincian Hill and is housed in the Villa Borghese, a building designed by the Dutch architect Jan van Santen (Giovanni Vasanzio) and built between 1613 and 1616.\nThe paintings were largely collected in the 17th century by Pope Paul V (Camillo Borghese) and his nephew Cardinal Scipione Borghese, while the antiquities were primarily obtained by Marcantonio Borghese in the 18th century and by Francesco Borghese in the 19th century. In 1902 the villa and its collection were acquired from the Borghese family by the Italian government.",

Designers intentionally pick tall, slender females to wear their clothes on the runway as their bodies reflect the fashion industry's strict idea of beauty. But, I don't think any corporations would admit to favouring tall\nemployees. A fast fix for all short guys would be to use height raising shoe lifts like those from liftheightinsoles.com for particular occasions. However, we will need to be mindful of our own unconscious discrimination en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_discrimination when making decision about the folks in our lives - whether it's selecting a great partner or our upcoming Prime Minister.",

Then there are the committed couples who are assured of a \"sure thing\" every night, which is also known as \"the marriage advantage.\"\nDespite the ease of accessibility, why are American adults having less sex compared to what they were having around 20 years ago?\nA paper published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior in March this year found that American adults are having less sex than they did a couple of decades ago. Analysis of data from 1989 to 2014 also showed that frequency of sex among married people saw a drastic decline when compared to unmarried couples or single adults.\nThe paper showed an overall drop in sexual activity across race, gender, region, work status and education level.\u201d\n#TYT",

Traditionally, it's discarded as medical waste, with the umbilical cord that connects it to the baby being snipped, often by an excited father.\nHowever, there's a rapidly growing birthing trend among young parents where they are delaying cutting the cord for days, letting it detach from the placenta on its own.\nIt's called \"lotus birth,\" and it's caught on among parents who believe it conveys remarkable, almost magical benefits to their newborns.\u201d\n#TYT",

Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, and Jayde Lovell, hosts of The Young Turks, tell you how the Japanese government is trying to help.\n\u201cThe Japanese might be the hardest working people in the world. Employees there sleep less and work longer hours than almost anywhere else. The culture is so rigorous that there's a word for literally working yourself to death: karoshi.\nThat might be good if you're an employer trying to make a deadline or cut costs. But it's bad if you're a country with a falling birthrate and a population of people who say they're too busy and exhausted to have children.\nSo officials are launching a new campaign to get employees out of the office. Dubbed \u201cPremium Friday,\u201d it will encourage companies to let workers leave early on the last Friday of the month. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is also pushing a measure to cap overtime, which he says he'll enforce with random inspections. These come on the heels of major investigations into Mitsubishi and Dentsu, both accused of forcing excessive work. At Dentsu, a 24-year-old woman killed herself after putting in 100 hours of overtime.\u201d\n#TYT",

As a result, the number of doctors prescribing this drug has actually decreased significantly. This also has to do with some federal regulation banning some people getting access to the drug due to fears of abuse. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian of The Young Turks break it down.\nOxyContin is a dying business in America.\nWith the nation in the grip of an opioid epidemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives, the U.S. medical establishment is turning away from painkillers. Top health officials are discouraging primary care doctors from prescribing them for chronic pain, saying there is no proof they work long-term and substantial evidence they put patients at risk.\nPrescriptions for OxyContin have fallen nearly 40% since 2010, meaning billions in lost revenue for its Connecticut manufacturer, Purdue Pharma.\nSo the company\u2019s owners, the Sackler family, are pursuing a new strategy: Put the painkiller that set off the U.S. opioid crisis into medicine cabinets around the world.\n#TYT",

Kadin, she said, has been diagnosed with lead poisoning.\nHe has lots of company: Within 15 blocks of his house, at least 120 small children have been poisoned since 2010, making the neighborhood among the most toxic in Missouri, Reuters found as part of an analysis of childhood lead testing results across the country.

Ana Kasparian and John Iadarola, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\"Despite popular belief that millennials are entitled and lazy, research actually suggests that millennials are work martyrs. A work martyr is defined by Project: Time Off, as a person who believes it is more important to work long hours over true productivity. The work martyr often won\u2019t take breaks or use vacation time out of fear he or she may be seen as replaceable or undedicated to the job. Project: Time Off\u2019s surveyfound that roughly 40% of employees desired to be seen as a work martyr by their employer, however, 86% of employees surveyed, believed it was a bad thing to be seen as a work martyr by their families.\nHow can an employee achieve work-life balance if he or she is attempting to be so much to so many people? According to Project: Time Off\u2019s survey, it comes at a high price. Work martyrs are actually more likely to earn less and receive fewer bonuses. Work martyrs are also more likely to put pressure on themselves, have a misplaced sense of pride, and feel unsupported at work. However, the greatest consequence of work martyrdom lies in stress levels, both at the office and at home. Work martyrs are 13% more likely to feel stress in their work/life compared to more balanced employees, and 20% more likely to feel stress at home.\u201d*\n#TYT",

Hardin wound up hiding from the world in a backwoods cabin in North Carolina. Divorced, alcoholic and at times suicidal, he had tried almost all the accepted treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder: psychotherapy, group therapy and nearly a dozen different medications.\n\u201cNothing worked for me, so I put aside the idea that I could get better,\u201d said Mr. Hardin, 37. \u201cI just pretty much became a hermit in my cabin and never went out.\u201d\nThen, in 2013, he joined a small drug trial testing whether PTSD could be treated with MDMA, the illegal party drug better known as Ecstasy.\n\u201cIt changed my life,\u201d he said in a recent interview in the bright, airy living room of the suburban ranch house here, where he now lives while going to college and working as an airplane mechanic. \u201cIt allowed me to see my trauma without fear or hesitation and finally process things and move forward.\u201d\nBased on promising results like Mr. Hardin\u2019s, the Food and Drug Administration gave permission Tuesday for large-scale, Phase 3 clinical trials of the drug \u2014 a final step before the possible approval of Ecstasy as a prescription drug.\nIf successful, the trials could turn an illicit street substance into a potent treatment for PTSD.\nThrough a spokeswoman, the F.D.A. declined to comment, citing regulations that prohibit disclosing information about drugs that are being developed.\n\u201cI\u2019m cautious but hopeful,\u201d said Dr. Charles R.

    "title": "For Rural Australian Women, Abortion Pill is Inaccessible",
    "votes": 1,
    "content": "Women in remote areas of Australian towns have to bear the outdated abortion pill laws, and travel overnight to reach pregnancy termination clinics by escaping local conservatism. Will telemedicine be the answer?\nTennant Creek has a total of 3,062 residents, and the fifth largest town belonging to Northern Territory of Australia. Alice Springs, a center that offers pregnancy termination is the closest urban facility that is six hours away. For those from the remote area, reaching the clinic is a long drive. One third of the country\u2019s population come from rural regions, many facing problems accessing services that city-dwellers find no issue to get. One of such facilities includes abortions, and one in three Australian women will want it in her lifetime.\nThis concludes that a large number f Australian females from rural origins must travel long distances to get their pregnancy terminated, while availability of abortion pill again are inaccessible due to lack of telemedicine services. Discreet procedure is thus common, and hotlines involve calling physician for a prescription drug, which are them sent over to the person. If only getting medications over the internet or simple applications were legal, the vast geographical divide would not have been so complex.\nRestrictive Legislation Hinders Healthcare\nIncompatible legislation varies from state to state. Some areas have short supply of female doctors, which make many seekers for pregnancy termination uncomfortable. In New South Wales and Queensland, ending pregnancy is technically a crime for women as well as doctors. In Northern Territory, surgical removal of fetus in remote communities is only legal up to 14 weeks of gestation where at least two doctors must certify that the person\u2019s mental or physical health is in danger from her pregnancy. Thus, limitations and prohibitions make it difficult for seeking pregnancy ending.\nElsewhere, the surgical method for fetus ousting is available until 20 or 24 weeks of gestation, with medication technique allowed till 10 weeks. Getting MTP Kit medicines for ceasing a pregnancy is sometimes as problematic, as the medicine is illegal across Northern Territory and accessible from clinics in Australian Capital Territory or Southern part of the country only. Thus, not everyone can receive the drugs from email, making the procedure almost illegitimate for citizens in the nation, until they are ready to visit areas with the facility to end pregnancy.\nProblems and Risks for Rural Women\nTravel and expenses are not what every person from rural region can afford. The combined stress is not only unfeasible but dangerous for women\u2019s health. Barriers to abortion pills access in remote Australian regions are very little spoken about. Some women from rural areas who received pregnancy termination were interviewed, saying that they had to spend hundreds and thousands of dollars and spend one to nine hours for one way travel to reach the clinic, and few required overnight accommodation.\nIn towns where local practitioners are missing, the ordeal for females is not to be neglected. The stigma attached to pregnancy termination is reflected in remote regions, making the procedure almost a taboo in Australian rural provinces. Some women have to hide her identity and get abortion pills online, but the risks are great, as none are sure if the tablets would reach them or will the package be interrupted. Not all website giving the medicines are real or genuine, thus risks of dangers for pregnancy ending lingers overhead of women from Australia.",

It\u2019s commonly purchased from smoke shops or online providers without any federal regulation.\nBut now, the DEA is placing it under the most restrictive category of controlled substances, Schedule I.\nDecades of anecdotal evidence have found that some people have successfully used kratom in the place of hydrocodone or methadone, popular drugs used by doctors to treat opioid addiction.

    "votes": 7,
    "content": "In my time cycling I've seen plenty of bad fittings and made some poor decisions myself.\nHopefully this post will bring some attention to this topic and help you when buying a bike.\nKnow your size\nIt helps to have a rough size estimate before you choose a bike. You can find charts from the manufacturers, detailing the frame size recommended for your dimensions. Before you buy, ask for a test ride to see if the frame fits.\nI've seen things like broken seat-posts or saddle rails because the rider tried to compensate for a frame that is too big or too small.\nAdjusting your bike\nMany cyclists keep their saddle lower than they should because they're used to stopping without leaving the saddle. The problem with this is that it puts more strain on your knees when you pedal and, in time, it can cause joint pain.\nThe handle bars should be at the same level or slightly lower than the seat. This way your back will arch downwards and your muscles will help soak up bumps.\nIf your bike/bars are set for a more upright position by design (like on a cruiser or city-bike) make sure you have proper cushioning to protect your back. I recommend installing a springed saddle or a springed seatpost for this.\nDon't buy cheap\nHypermarkets often have cheap bikes that may seem like a bargain. Avoid them like the plague. These bikes are heavy ( sometimes over 15 kg !) and the build quality is abysmal. Part after part will fail: pedals, cranks, bearings, tires, brakes, etc. I've had the unfortunate experience of dealing with this sort of bike and it isn't worth it. It turns into an endless money pit.\nYou can get a much better product from a bike shop or, if you're on a tight budget, from a second hand seller.\nIf the bike comes with plastic pedals have them changed in the store. They don't last more than 2-3 weeks so it's better to replace them straight away.\nIn conclusion\nHopefully this post will help you choose and fit your bike. If you have any questions or suggestions let me know :D",

    "content": "Article:\nhttp://www.rawstory.com/2016...\nOne country just passed a law that would lock up vegans if their kid is malnourished. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\u201cNew draft legislation proposed by the Italian government could see parents imprisoned for feeding their children a vegan diet. Those legally responsible for under-16s who display signs of malnutrition resulting in illness or long-term health problems could be sentenced for up to four years.\nA member of of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party, Elvira Savino, is pushing the government to approve the law following several high-profile cases in the country.\n\u201cFor some years the belief has been spreading in Italy that a vegetarian diet, even in the rigid form of a vegan diet, results in significant health benefits,\u201d Savino said. \u201cThere can be no objection if the person making this choice is an informed adult. A problem arises when minors are involved.\"\nIn four cases over the last 18 months, malnourished children were hospitalized after being fed a vegan diet.\nIn July, a 14-month-old baby was taken to hospital in Milan by his grandparents, weighing only slightly more than a 3-month-old, independent European news website The Local reported. Calcium deficiency resulting from a vegan diet was cited as the reason for the baby\u2019s severely stunted growth. The head pediatrician at the Milan hospital said that any children being raised on a vegan diet should be given supplements, particularly iron and calcium. Around 2.8 percent of the Italian population are vegan.\u201d\n#TYT",

The public's health is in danger.\u201d\nCongress is now debating the funding level for STD prevention grants in the fiscal year beginning October 1, and the prospects for an increase are not good, Smith said. Syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia are all covered in one block of money sent to states and cities through the CDC, and that line item has remained flat, at around $157 million, for the last several years. In a letter to members of the Senate, Smith wrote that funding for STD prevention had dropped by $21 million since 2003, which he said represented a 40 percent loss in purchasing power for prevention programs.",

    "title": "Further explanation of my thoughts re: Empeopled 2.0",
    "votes": 67,
    "content": "Before going into detail I think it would be helpful to rehash what about Empeopled motivates me, and what I see as its differentiating factor:\nEmpeopled aims to introduce self-governance to 'the crowd' so that it may navigate itself into the future.\nIt's not that governance is sexy, or fun, it's that it's necessary for coordinated action among large groups of people towards a common set of goals. To date, there are very few options for self-governance on the Internet, and Empeopled would ultimately like to change that.\nEmpeopled 1.x (what you see now) is a specific vision of such a system of governance, one that rewards contribution, and uses weighted voting based on that contribution to make collective decisions. Decisions like what content and commentary to pay attention to (and thus who to pay attention to), as well as what the rules are, and who its moderators are. Surely, a limited, but observable example of a new type of crowd-based online governance - and one meant to be dynamic from the outset.\nHowever, it is merely one embodiment of an infinite set of possibilities. Different reward structures, voting rules, decision algorithms, offices (aside from moderator), and software might be better serve different communities aiming at different goals.\nEmpeopled 2.0, as I see it, would focus on opening the levers of power to customization for any given community started on the new platform. And, relatedly, anyone could start a new community on Empeopled 2.0, each with their own customized rewards structures, rules, decision algorithms, offices, and eventually software (through a public API, like Facebook's).\nThe benefits of this is that we can crowd-source new and innovative governance structures that benefit online communities of varying description best - in parallel, and at a faster rate of innovation. This also creates a much stronger incentive for the crowd to promote the site's growth as now many creators will have more ownership of what they're building.\nHowever, Empeopled 2.0, will, out of practical necessity, and strategic wisdom (speaking from experience), be an minimally viable product (MVP)- stripped of as many features and complexity as possible to expand and deepen the core strength it seeks to bring to the table: the customization of the governance structures/power levers. This will inevitably lead to a loss of features that many probably now enjoy, though that loss may well be temporary, based on organic demand to build the features back in later.\nIn the meantime Empeopled 1.x will continue to operate, and even after initial release into beta, 2.0 could operate in parallel. Eventually I see 1.x being folded into a specific implementation (community) in 2.0, with its current settings (topics, rewards, rules, etc) in place. The core Empeopled platform then, would no longer have much of a role to play in interfering with each communities except in that it would have a minimalist constitution: not to interfere with them at all, unless illegal and/or hate-based activity is involved.\nIronically, this turns out to be a fairly libertarian approach. I say ironically, because many conservative guests here feel very out of place based on the predominant liberal leanings of current members. This new platform essentially says: 'you do it your way, we'll do it ours, and let's see which works best.' The lessons learned benefit everyone. It's Darwinian process applied to governance models - though granted, in a limited, online fashion.\nPlease let me know your thoughts on the above in the comments section!",

    "content": "Hi all,\nAs many of you know, DFs have been a slow going affair for a while now as we've struggled to find the resources to make them what they should be. That, and our increasing aging tech stack and code creep, have led me to a place where I'd like to invoke the right I always held to turn Empeopled into the parallel-governing communities I've always wanted it to be and spend our limited resources doing that instead.\nThe goal is to create a platform where anyone can create their own community, with their own rules, rewards and voting systems, leadership structures, and eventually software (through a public API, like Facebook Apps).\nThe broader Empeopled platform will then transition to a minimalist level of governance:\n1) keeping the lights on\n2) enforcing US law when necessary\n3) keeping hate groups out\nand otherwise allowing those parallel communities to do what they please and fail or succeed as they please.\nI don't want to just announce this without speaking to you all first and getting your feedback, but as it stands this was always the long-term goal, and given how thin our resources are I'd rather we focus our efforts on the long-term solution instead of half-baked monthly feature additions and a slower or no progress on the long term vision.\nYour thoughts?\nWe can still do things like add/delete topics, elections, rule changes, UI changes, etc, but no real feature additions if we go down this route.",

It's a choice between adding keywords to topic discovery, or having the ability to track on your profile page what posts and comments you've tapped.\nI just wanted to share my personal thoughts on this. Since the Great Topic Culling and Merge, Empeopled now only has a grand total of 45 topics, which does not take very long at all to look through on the topic discovery page by simply scrolling, as well as the All feed. What the site doesn't have is an easy way to go back and find an old post or comment if you need to reference it again.\nIt feels to me that while we have a lower number of topics, valuable coding work going towards topic discovery seems like a waste, whereas enhancing site functionality to make ease of use and quality of life improvements is time well spent.\nRegardless of which option you prefer, if you haven't voted yet, go vote! These are just my personal thoughts of which of the two options would be more useful immediately. I'd love to hear anyone else's if they'd like to share or discuss.\nThanks!",

    "content": "Hello everyone.\nWhen @Aris posted the most recent DtF thread, one of the main things that came from it (albeit without solutions right now) was that people are unhappy with the amount of spam posts and [VI] posts that currently get posted to the site, above and beyond the ones @Stardust and I manage to catch and moderate.\nI've been thinking about possible ways to get around this, and there were lots of good suggestions in that thread by some people.\nOne thought, although it would require back-end coding changes (correct me if I'm wrong @Aris, @luis) is that we could potentially restrict the ability to make posts to any individual topic until people have reached a certain level in said topic. If we can do that on a per-topic basis, we could leave Welcome to Empeopled and People of Empeopled open for posts by new members with no problem, but the remaining topics could have a minimum level requirement for people to be able to post posts.\nTherefore, if someone joins and just wants to post their crap, they're unable to except in WtE and PoE (which @Stardust and I would catch pretty quickly). If they want to post stuff in any other topics, they have to actually comment and interact with the community in those topics for a little while first. I'm not thinking super high level, just something easy enough to achieve without being onerous. 10, maybe? 5? Basically anything that isn't 0, so it restricts day-one posting ability.\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or comments on this? I'd like to hear opinions for or against, any effects you think it might have on the community etc, whether it's even possible at some point (@Aris @luis). Just to be clear, this isn't me suggesting we do this, just throwing around an idea as it's obviously a bone of contention for a lot of members currently.\nThanks!",

    "votes": 73,
    "content": "First of all I want to say that this is an inofficial poll which is not affiliated with direct changes towards the website. Just me asking the question to see what the thoughts on the subject are.\nI have been here on this website for quite some time now. The bitcoin system was something which caught my attention quite quickly, because it was something unordinary in comparsion with what other websites got. I saw it as a way to reward active members with more than a pat on the back. But as time goes, my opinion on it has changed.\nThe bitcoin system is something which looks interesting on the shell, but in reality is worthless. Hence I am stating the thesis that we should remove the bitcoin system.\nWhy? There are three main reasons in my opinion.\n1) It has no value and is pretty much useless.\nThe bitcoins we earn are sBTC. These bitcoins are worth a fraction of whatever currency you are usually using. There is neither an obvious way for us to actually use this small amount.\nLet's make a test here to see how much it is worth for you.\nStep one: Go to your profile.\nStep two: Multiply \"Total earnings\" with 0.\nStep three: Get struck by the realization.\n2) It does not attract people who wants to do something for the website. It only attracts greed.\nThe people who join here due to the bitcoin system doesn't join because it was a cool widget besides the awesome website. They join because of the bitcoins.\nIs this what we want? \"Signed up for the bitcoin.\"\n3) It cause more concern than attraction.\nThis should explain itself.\nWhy keep it?\nThe only reason as to why we should keep it is because of rewarding the users.\nBut why does it have to be bitcoins?\nIf they don't hold any value, then why does it need to be bitcoins? We can use a neutral value currency, instead of something which is tied to an value. Why not use \"Empounds\" or \"Empeso\" or \"Empeoints\"? It doesn't have to be of an value if it's only function is to show of how active you are.\nThoughts?",

    "votes": 82,
    "content": "In light of recent events, I feel it would be valuable for the community to determine our policies on the limits of speech here at Empeopled. While I think we can all agree that personal attacks aren't conducive to productive discussion, I feel that the community needs to come together and make a determination of what speech is worth protecting and what speech we're unwilling to tolerate as a community. In addition, I feel a discussion is warranted as far as the limits of these rules - for example, should posts with relatively minor insults be subject to moderation? Should this also extend to posts that are insulting in more subtle ways, such as use of condescension or passive aggression? If not, how do we define that distinction?\nWhile I recognize I've phrased this as a ternary question due to the limits of polling, I feel it's also important to recognize the gradient of what can be considered personal attacks, and I feel open discussion is the best way to determine where our redlines are as a community and how to define them.\nPlease bear in mind this is not a response to or attack on any members in particular, but an attempt to start a broader discussion on the limits of freedom of speech within our community. Obviously, civility should and will continue to be encouraged.",

Stick them between FAQ and Legal or something.\nWould this need to be a DtF? It seems like a relatively light code change, but I think it would help making the rules a little more obvious.

    "votes": 84,
    "content": "Let me preface the little tear I'm about to go on by saying I love Empeopled and the Empeopled community. But I haven't been here for awhile. The clusterjam in the area of topic creation has made the site less than it could be. There could be others who feel the same, I don't know. But it's definitely true in my case.\nAnd I don't understand it. Now, like I said I haven't been around much lately and I'll get around to exactly why. Maybe you guys are addressing the problem and I just haven't tinkered with the site enough to notice. If that's the case then set me straight in the comments.\nThe problem is the topics created after the reddit exodus are still here. And the kafkaesque, bureaucratic approach to dealing with them is making the site unusable for what I really hoped I could use it for. So yes, this post is hella selfish. But the fact of the matter is the people who created most of those topics are long gone while there are people here who want to create new, vibrant, viable topics but can't because the topic creation process is so bass-ackward since that boom happened.\nTake a hatchet to the dead topics already, and open up topic creation at a reasonable level so the community can get back on a natural growth path again. I say this last part not knowing the stats & figures. You guys know that.\nI'm a blogger, an organizer, and an appreciator of stuff. I want the ability to create niche communities so that I can move some of the conversations that are happening on the inferior comment platforms of other websites to an empeopled topic instead. I want to bring new people here but I can't. It's like I can't invite my friends over for Thanksgiving dinner because grandma's a hoarder so there's no room for them to come in and the house is overflowing with old, useless crap and the whole thing's embarrassing as hell.\nC'mon. It's been months now. This thing has got to be expedited. It feels like the whole approach to getting rid of old topics is to not offend a bunch of people who aren't even here anymore. It's also a bit of complacence. Empeopled has become a nice, cozy, friendly corner of the internet that we all appreciate. And some of us are closer to each other than others because part of that community is actually relationships IRL that flourished here. All that's great. I like nice. I like cozy. I like comfortable.\nBut I also like useful, elegant and dynamic. And my experience with topic creation has been none of those since the middle of 2015. I'm begging you guys to quit groupthinking this thing to death and just take care of it already so I can invite my friends over to play.\nThanks all. /rant",

I assume that's the case.\nNot that gaming the system to get taps is really too much of a thing currently with the value of taps, but might this be something to consider? I assume the purpose of cross-posting is to increase views and therefore get more comments and interactions on any given post, and to highlight it to different readerships (topic followers), rather than to accrue more taps for your post. Since cross-posting leaves all the comments for the post on the original post rather than splitting them between two (or more) posts, is there any facility (or need) to limit the taps someone gets to the original post as well?\nOr am I wondering about something that no one cares about?",

    "content": "Hi all, per OP request plus a thread that felt it was going down the wrong path, I moderated a post.\nA non-mod member then challenged my decision as arbitrary (my words, not theirs), and inconsistent with our process and values. Though I did not see it that way when I did it, I saw their point.\nTo clarify, I spoke with the moderators and polled them to see if I had misstepped. they believed I had, because any 'toxic' comment could be moderated individually, but deleting the whole thing was deleting public property (an argument I've made before and has precedent), especially since there was a lot of interesting conversation elsewhere in the thread. So, if anything is seen as toxic in that thread, please flag it for review and we can moderate it accordingly.\nIf you have issue with how any of this went down, you're not alone. I messed up and I'm sorry. I should have thought and consulted with the mods first before acting in this unusual way. A couple of takeaways from this to improve in the future:\n1) We should create a more formal mod voting system to overturn other mod decisions\n2) We should create a more formal Empeopled Court process to challenge mod decisions (including overturns). Right now it's kind of a complaint box that I seem to dictatorially control the outcome of, which is fine if that's what we want, but I'm guessing it isn't.\nI'm very sorry to have messed this up, but I'm trying to recover as best as possible in terms of rule of law and transparency.",

What happens after that is to be discussed.\nHere are the top suggestions about the nomination process and the voting process in no particular order.\nPM Aris your name and have him put them in no particular order in a poll. The poll should allow for people to vote for more than one person (or vote for however many Mods we are needing) This removes the weight of votes by higher numbered members.\nPM Aris your name and have him list them in a thread in no particular order. This allows for higher ranked members to have more weight with their votes.\nFind a way to hide the number of votes each nomination has. Find a way to have all the nominations presented at the same time.\nAllow for others to nominate those they want to see as Mods. Nominees would have the right to refuse.\nSecond part of the issue was the number of Mods we should have.\nThe number of mods suggested was between 5 and 9.\nI propose that we hold off on a final decision about mod numbers until we discuss the community liaisons and ECC positions next week. There seems to be too much uncertainty about what we will need, since we haven\u2019t decided how the breakdown of positions is going to be.\nThis however, is only a suggestion and if you want us to poll for numbers this week we can.",

Taps and slaps determine your standing in the election.\nThe top ranking 11 nominations become moderators.\nThe Issues:\nThe issues that some users found with this is that higher level users have more more points, and thus, more influence on the elections, than lower leveled users. Some feel that this should not be the case, and that the influence of users on the voting process should be equal.\nIt was also mentioned that the self nomination set the tone for the first few posts to always be elected and lower posts to get overlooked.\nAdditionally, there is a concern that 11 moderators is overkill for the current population of Empeopled. Some feel that 11 is unnecessary, and opens us up to vulnerability, as we currently don\u2019t have the population to justify this amount of moderators.\nThe hopes for this is to promote discussion of said issue, and perhaps find a solution, if we need one.\nThe Discussion\nShould we change the way the election process is run?

Repeatedly click \"Flush Socket Pools\" until everything but the top two rows are gone. The error should be clear now, and you can go back to browsing.\nThe suggestion: There should be some kind of permanent topic that everybody is subscribed to, where this kind of thing can be posted in case the website has issues, and another for tech support. The permanent, universally-subscribed one should be accessible for posting only by moderators and admins. That way, stuff like this could be posted to the tech support topic and then copied over by a moderator. It would also come in handy in cases like today's Steam issues, which is why I say that moderators should universally have access to it.

    "votes": 22,
    "content": "So.\nI'm wondering how to get greater engagement from people on here. Not for my posts, necessarily, but in general. Because it seems to me there's a lot of stuff posted, but there's very little engagement with those posts, comparatively.\nPartially, I think this is that there's a lot of threads posted which aren't given any description by the poster. Why was it posted? What's of interest? Why is this something worth reading? Why should I click through and watch a half-hour video from this YouTuber? A bare link with nothing to say why it's cool seems a bit odd, to be honest. It could be some posters are just pasting links that sound interesting, but they haven't read. That's fine - but surely the idea here is that links are curated, and the initial poster has thoughts on them? Otherwise we could all just be bots, automatically posting whatever gets pushed out of the RSS feeds of particular organs.\nI know the perceived logic is that thread turnover 'makes the site look busy' but I wonder if, when a crapload of those tend to be zero-comment threads, it actually makes it look a bit spammy rather than engaged? It seems it to me. I see a lot of zero-comment posts and it sort of makes me less likely to comment, as beyond the original poster (who often will post links without even passing comment on it) there's just a vacuum.\nFor me, I think part of it is that considering previously-posted content isn't part of the way people use this site - there's no real sense that anyone digs through the archive, so most of what's posted ends up as chip wrappers in a week or so. This annoys me, as there's plenty of topics that would benefit from having a master discussion thread rather than a bunch of disparate threads. I guess it seems to me that it's difficult to have a cohesive discussion on a certain topic spanning a bunch of threads because there is a real tendency to have to repeat oneself because the same points would keep coming up.\n(Remember, discussion here supports branches, so I think it's natural that there'd be an ability to keep going on a topic in general, without losing a sense of being able to comment on specific things.)\nI fully disclose that a lot of this stuff is prompted by things like the current US election stuff, in which I am obviously interested as the TPP has now stitched us together like some kind of freakish trans-hemispheric twin, but not so interested as people who can actually vote in the thing. It seems that every element of the election is posted multiple times, without a lot of interaction. (I'm looking at you, Putin and Trump.)\nI guess the important thing is that to me, a lot of this appears to be unconsidered, rather than curated, or posted with love. And I'm wondering how we can encourage people to post thoughtfully rather than just ctrl-c, ctrl-v BANG.",

Also, does it apply to that as well, or just if they are selling something, i.e., maybe a blog site that sells nothing, does that also have to be disclosed as a vested interest, or just if there's ads on the site that benefit them or something?",

Should be noted that I'm not a mod, this isn't a discussion on whether to change the rules or any kind of a vote to do anything, just things I noticed that probably deserve official scrutiny.\nMinor spelling and punctuation mistakes are present throughout the rules. Mostly it's just judgment being misspelled or a period being left off the end, really small stuff.\nLink to the direct source rule has a redundant sentence at the beginning along with punctuation mistake.\nNo fresh reposts and No duplicates rules contradict and are mostly redundant. As far as I can tell, one applies specifically to the topic source content is posted in, while the other applies across the whole site. NFR allows content to be reposted in that topic, while ND says duplicate posts can never be posted anywhere. And a question, would this limit a user to only cross-posting content once, as multiple cross posts would be duplicate posts?\nDon't ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation. The rule states: \"No colluding or using fake accounts to manipulate scores of posts, comments, or governance issues.\" However, by using the word fake, rather than something like additional, it leaves a loophole whereby a user can use hacked real accounts to manipulate votes, something the rule is obviously meant to prohibit. Because the real account holder is unaware of the improper use of their account it isn't covered under collusion.\nNo Spam rule states \"Thoughtful, contextual self-promotion is fine...\" but this is already covered by disclosure of vested interest rule and by not being as specific as the VI rule, misleads users on proper conduct in this regard.",

The way we do this should be discussed too, either by presenting a case to the community saying why the topic should be labeled as such, or just by a simple pool.\nRight now, this can be achieved by simply keeping a list of these \"permanent\" topics, and there's no programming needed, but in the future, if this idea passes, it would be good to implement it in the code too.",

I hope everything is going well for you and if you are down at the moment I hope things go back on the upswing as soon as possible.\nIt seems you've been on quite the mission this very Monday (or Tuesday I suppose depending on where you are)... I'm really sorry if something I did offended you. But, please, please dear Slapper- stop methodically going through all my posts and comments and slapping them because you obviously have a personal problem with me.\nI know I am not the only person that this is happening to. I've seen about 6 others also experiencing this unwarranted abuse of the \"slap\". It's probably more than that.\nIt is not nice. It is not cool. You're kinda stepping on the whole fun aspect of the site, since now I am wary to post more content or comments as I may be slapped over and over again for something that is more than likely a personal vendetta.\nSo dear Slapper, I urge you to stop. I beg you even. Stop slapping my posts. Stop slapping the other good standing members of this communities posts/comments because of something that may have happened hours ago. If you have grievances please either air them out here, in the thread where your initial irritation occurred or privately message those whom have annoyed/offended/frustrated you so you can resolve things and not bottle it up and take it out passive-aggressively as you are now.\nThank you for your time. Best wishes!\nSincerely,\nEmberBreeze <3",

See below for the exact text of the new rules, which will be updated on the rules page as soon as @Aris is able to do it.\nNew rule\nLink to the direct source\nWhen linking to content on Empeopled, always link to the direct source of that content, video, site, image, or blog post. There is to be no middle-man linking, or linking to pages which then contain a secondary link to the content you are trying to share. Moderator judgement applies\nAmended rule\nDue to feedback in the poll, the wording has been changed slightly from the suggestion. Existing Affiliated Interest rule will be changed to:\nDisclosure of Vested Interests\nIf you are linking to any type of content in which you have a vested interest, this must be disclosed in one of two ways:\n1 - By using a [VI] tag in the post title\nOR\n2 - Adding a note in the post text explaining your connection to the posted content.\nContent you are considered to have a vested interest in includes, but is not limited to: Personal or commercial blogs and social media feeds (Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram etc), personal or vocational YouTube channels, affiliate sales links, or sites with direct sales of products, software or services. Moderator judgement applies\nBoth of these rules come into effect immediately, so if you see or suspect any posts or comments that break these rules, please flag them using the report function as normal. Obviously for a period after these come into effect, moderators will be happy to educate new and old users alike on these new rules to ease the transition.\nWe will post a \u2018review\u2019 in a month\u2019s time to see how the community feels these rules are working - whether they\u2019re having the desired effect, whether they\u2019re causing any problems, etc. Thanks!",

    "votes": 93,
    "content": "So if you visit an individual topics page, or if you pop into Discover Topics, you will see a follower number. The first and most obvious issue with this feature is that it's inaccurate and misleading. Several years and a reddit influx later and we're buried under thousands of inactive accounts. A user joining the site today is completely misled about our size, anyone looking in see's a much larger community than there is. I don't think those accounts should be deleted, but I don't think they should be used to mislead either. Another issue with this is they are a false indication of activity, you see that a topic may have 5,000 followers but only a handful of intermittent posts.\nSo I have two ideas for alternatives.\nEither show the number of posts in a given time frame.\nor\nShow the number of followers of that topic currently online.\nWhat are your thoughts on all of this? Are these good or terrible alternatives? Do you think this is even an issue? Do you have a solution of your own?",

For example, when linking to fitness gear on amazon using an affiliate link, I should make it clear that the link will generate affiliate revenue for me.\nTo:\nDisclosure of Vested Interests\nIf you are linking to any type of content in which you have a vested interest, this must be disclosed by using a [VI] tag in the post title, OR a note in the post text explaining.

Technical changes will take longer as they require background work, but other changes, such as a change to one of the rules, would be effective as soon as the third step of the process is complete.\nAll future site changes (aside from changes voted on in the Decide the Future) will go through the process listed above.\nIf you have any suggestions for changes, make a post in /t/empeopled_suggestions and it will be discussed and considered. We have a compiled list of every suggestion that was made thus far, and will add future suggestions to that list.\nPlease feel free to ask any questions in the comments!",

The main goal with this process is to reform procedural issues, with as little need to the site itself as possible on a technical level (for now).\nThe main improvement this proposal seeks to make is:\n1) formalize the change process with 3 steps (discuss, propose, vote)\n2) identify who will initiate the process (the 3 person committee)\n3) get changes more efficiently underway\nAny and all finalized processes will need to be documented and accessible by all. I will also work to make them more visible on the site (in its own page, or section).\nThis poll ends on 11/1/15 at Noon PST\nPlease note that moderators will still be able to moderate if they get elected into this committee",

When you wish too buy something say what and how many in your Turn (doesnt use any AP)\nAlthough people who get more BTC technically have a better chance at winning, this isnt such the case as you can trade items with players (within range) and teams will be split even. You have a MIN amount of points so no one goes without\nEach persons turn is taken As follows, You get Two action points where you can spend them into these areas\nbuilding\nBuilding can be done via telling me how many, the block type and where in general you wish them placed and what you wish to protect. Just remember everyone else can see your message so dont give away your strategy\nmovement\nMovement is achieved by using a single AP to move anywhere in your bubble, if you wish too go further you can move via the second bubble but this will use 1 more AP. Moving past someone allows them a chance too hit you, you can walk and jump, although this is put up too common sense... climbing up walls requires ladders, ropes (fixed from the top) or jetpacks.\nVehicles can be used and the same system is used. Water damages. You can also hide in sufficient cover, but this doesnt make you hidden so much as harder to hit (requires 1 AP)\nFighing\nFighting can be done in two ways, either you use a Mele weapon/fists/enviroment which are in your first bubble. Or you use any range weapons which are in your second Bubble and in target. Explosives make a damage radius of A player bubble so try moving out of the way. You can remote detonate but require an additional item....\nhows its played\nEach person thats playing gets divided into two teams, on each side of the map in equal teams. Your mission if you choose to accept it is too destroy the Other team or critical infrastructure (marked on the Map). I will make a comment with the Map thats being played and those that are playing and all the Info you need. From there you need to plan your next 2 AP and tell me what you wish too do, buy, move, kill ect... (sent as a comment to my comment). Once everyone has added there comments for every member I do each persons role in order (random order at the start). Then make a log of what happened this round and present the Map updated with the next round starting in a new comment\nDoes this make sense?\nIf not MAKE sure too ask me any Questions\nIf so state your intrest for a Game too be played and it will start shortly\nWould it be better if I made this into a more D&D where I am the dungeon master? (I believe so... the mechanics would be the same either way)",

From this I can tell from the pevious score how much activity has been made on Emp, as this would likely cause people too drive towards bigger topics I am planning on checking the history for posts in smaller topics. Small topics could earn more points or a Special bonus.\nFrom here the User's score is added into a database that will be attached towards there unique avatar that can be used for an ingame user for many games and events. As they have a score that score could be implemented in many ways, and each point used by these games/events ect... can either be taken out of there Vitual currency or used without any effect. The possible implementations I have thought of are listed below\n- Used as a virtual currency to buy objects that would effect the game\n- Buy Clothing or astheitic items for Avatar (this can be implemented with smaller topics such as posting in /t/firefly for a cool browncoat!!)\n- Used as a Listing order for who will go first\n- Many many more things that I hope you understand the system I have made and want to update with your suggestions\nAs I am unsure how well I conveyed this I have made a Game for Emp which will be used for testing, the post for that game is here . It is a 2D WORM style Battle with Punching, shooting, building and Alliance driven game where only one survives.

These three buttons are new to you.\nAll three appear at every post, and only the shield appears on comments.\nLet's break these buttons down:\nShield: the shield button is used to moderate things.\nthe arrow is used to move posts to a more appropriate topic.\nthe pin is to sticky things at the top of a topic: try to use this for informational purposes.\nMore about The Shield:\nYou see the shield in two places: posts and comments. See here.\nWhen you press the shield, this happens.\nExact Punishment:\nThis does exactly what it says it does. It removes the post, and deducts however many points based on offense from the user. This can even result in banning. You should use this sparingly as much as possible. Uncheck it.\nBroke a Rule:\nFrom the drop down list, you can pick a rule that the user broke. This is less severe. When this is unchecked, this happens. This can be used to delete duplicate posts, or posts that users want deleted.\nWhen you create a post, you also have an additional new tool- the \"Announce\" tool. Use this sparingly as well- we are trying to cut back on the amount of announcements we do already. But, it does what you expect: gives everyone following the topic a notification and email.\nLet us know if you have any questions. Excuse any typos as I made this post on my phone.\nEdit: Also please pm either @MattStrzok, @HeroOfCanton, or I your emails. We will loop you in to the Google docs we share for reporting. We use a specific doc to document our actions against a flag. You should ALWAYS check the document first before taking action.",

    "content": "As discussed here, we need to come up with a streamlined way to discuss, propose, and vote on political changes in a way that minimizes my interaction, both because of my own limitations, but also in the spirit of turning over more and more control to the community.\nTo that end, I'm proposing that a good starting point, would be for the moderators to vote on a committee of 3 among themselves (since many have said they are over-staffed in the current cycle anyway), that will initiate discussions on changes with the [Discuss] tag, [Propose] based on the digested results of those discussions, and then [Poll] the final decisions to the community at large. For now, while this process proves itself out, I'd keep a veto power as the final check, but otherwise it would be up to me to implement the proposed changes.\nNote that changes requiring technical changes will be more problematic, though it seems we will have a new dev coming on board very soon. The main goal with this process is to reform procedural issues, with as little need to the site itself as possible on a technical level (for now).\nThe main improvement this proposal seeks to make is:\n1) formalize the change process with 3 steps (discuss, propose, vote)\n2) identify who will initiate the process (the 3 person committee)\n3) get changes more efficiently underway\nWhat are everyone's thoughts on this proposal",

Please give that post and all the comments a thorough read before responding to this poll. This is NOT a snap poll that will change the site - this is just me gathering interest and opinions to present to @Aris.\nThere are two questions (Q1 and Q2).\nQuestion 1 is a simple yes/no as to whether you all think adding the rule to link to the direct source only would be useful and beneficial to the site or not. Please only select either option A or B for Q1.\nQuestion 2 is a multi-option question. All three options encompass changing the affiliated link description to cover all forms of content you're personally involved with, which would encompass social network feeds, blogs, websites and YouTube channels.\nThe first option is to require personal content to have a [PC] tag in the post's title going forward. Option two is to have a [PC] tag in the title and a note in the text explaining that the poster is linked to the content in some way. Option three is to only require a note in the post text. Option four is to leave the existing rule as it is and not change it. Please only select one option from Q2, A, B, C or D.\nTo vote, select your option from Q1, AND select your option from Q2, then press the 'vote' button to cast your votes.\nEDIT: I'd highly suggest people read @insomnia's comment below before voting, as it applies to Q2 and makes a solid point.\nThanks very much!",

    "content": "EDIT: to clarify, I'm specifically trying to address a new system for making changes, inclusive of personnel if necessary, and a documented procedure for doing so\nRight now, there seem to be a lot of good ideas for improving the political process - from how to submit nominations to the number of mods we should have to what the proposal process should be.\nThese are all good, and I endorse enacting such changes, based on the community's will - but the truth is, I need your help managing even this aspect of Empeopled. Aside from my 2 other full-time jobs, I spend a lot of time with the not so fun logistics of Empeopled, from finance, to servers, to recruiting developers. I just can't do a satisfactory job of everything.\nSo, with your blessing, I'd like to get us to a state where my responsibilities are keeping the lights on, managing the devs, and acting as a last resort check and balance for the community. To get to that point, I think we need to come up with some sort of committee or czar that proposes a system for political reform that doesn't depend on my direct intervention (aside from technical aspects).\nThis is a complicated thing to come up with, and most likely anything we come up with will need further reform, but the alternative is my mediocre performance.\nI assure you this isn't a matter of my laziness or lack of enthusiasm for Empeopled, merely an admission of my own limitations.\nSo how can we put together a system to change how things are done around here - specifically how the procedural aspects are done? What is the first concrete, small step we take so that we don't have to come up with a total solution in the comments section below (which would be chaos).",

    "title": "[Mod Post] Discussion: Proposition of new site rule and change to existing rule",
    "votes": 109,
    "content": "Moderator post:\nHello all!\nAs I said in my comment here I think one of the biggest problems Empeopled faces now, and especially in future, is the amount of people, sites and entities trying to use the site to advertise their content, get followers and subscribers, and push their wares. I have noticed a lot as a moderator, that there are people who post links to specific sites over and over again, or who post content hosted on their own website instead of the original source, as well as people linking purely to their own YouTube channels or Twitter/Instagram feeds.\nThere is no reason Empeopled can't be used for these purposes, but it needs to be much clearer for the users that this is the case, and for the moderators when responding to reported suspect posts. To that end I'd like to propose one new rule to be added to the Empeopled Rules, and one change to an existing rule.\nNew rule suggestion\nI would like to have a new rule created as follows:\nLink to the direct source\nWhen linking to content on Empeopled, always link to the direct source of that content, video, site, image, or blog post. There is to be no middle-man linking, or linking to pages which then contain a secondary link to the content you are trying to share.\nExplanation: There have been several incidents recently where posts have been to a link which redirects users through multiple other pages before arriving at the intended link, and also posts where users have linked to their personal Twitter or Instagram posts, or personal blog posts, those posts of which then contain the link to the content they wanted to share. At the very least, this is one extra click to go through to get to content, and at the worst it leaves people vulnerable to being linked through shady sites or irrelevant social media they don't care about before seeing the content. This rule would stop that, and also goes some way towards recognising the original creator of the content by linking to their site.\nChange to existing rule suggestion\nThe current rule reads as follows: Disclosure of Affiliate Interests\nIf you are linking to something that might generate an affiliate sale for you, this must be disclosed. For example, when linking to fitness gear on amazon using an affiliate link, I should make it clear that the link will generate affiliate revenue for me.\nMy suggestion is to reword and expand this rule slightly. I would like to implement a tag system whereby any and all posts that link to a user's personal content or any sites which they have a direct link to are tagged as such in the post title, regardless of whether they use an affiliate link, are videos or websites that are monetised with ads or not, are sites with direct sales of products, software or services, or are links to personal or company social media (be they blogs, Twitter, Instagram etc). These posts, when correctly tagged, can then be posted to any suitable topics around the site without breaking rules. In terms of how to tag it, something simple like [PC] for personal content, or some other acronym like that would work.\nThis has the benefit of making the posting of personal content and what is and isn't okay far less ambiguous for both users and moderators. All a user has to do is tag their post, and if they don't, a moderator will moderate it. There's no grey area about what constitutes advertising, or whether someone can earn money from the post or not etc. This should make things smoother and easier going forward as well.\nOf course, this doesn't include things like posting pictures of yourself or that you've taken in topics like People of Empeopled etc, this is just for links to external sites.\nSo! Those are my suggestions. I'm eager to hear peoples' thoughts and comments. Once we've discussed, I'll put up a poll or two to see what people think about implementing these rules, and then @Aris will possibly create a snap poll to change them officially.",

    "title": "Empeopled for Creators - How Empeopled could revolutionise supporting content creators and the web",
    "votes": 33,
    "content": "There's a growing shift away from the ad-supported model on free content and towards direct payment systems such as Patreon and the recently announced Youtube Red.\nMany podcasts, online videos, & webcomics are starting to shift towards whales as their core revenue source.\nWhat are whales? They are the pareto principle manifest. The pareto principle is the tendency for 80% of results coming from 20% of the causes. In the case of whales, they are the 20% of content consumers that generate 80% of the revenue.\nBefore this shift, free content took 100% of their revenue from 100% of their users using the ad model. Every consumer was equal, but adblock and this coming shift has started to disempeople certain consumers.\nContent creators have started to value their whales over other consumers , and this is nothing new. Free to play mobile games have already become whale-oriented and the consequence is clear to see when these F2P games are compared to their paid counterparts, counterparts that have started to be gripped by the temptation adopt certain F2P elements themselves.\nThis same disturbing path may be where online content is headed. I do not say this as a person who is jealous of whales, I'm a whale myself. I fund various content creators making a wide array of content, but I don't think this is the best way to support content creators.\nFunding content creators needs to be Empeopled. We need a way to support content creators without giving the whales all the power.\nI propose a central funding system be created, a single subscription on Empeopled rather than a per creator-model on sites like Patreon. The money from subscribers goes to the central treasury and is distributed to content creators in proportion to the amount of votes they get from all users using the site (as it is now).\nThis ensures that content creators get the full benefits of whale-generated revenue, while content consumers get to remain equal.\nBut why would these whales subscribe to a central system to support the content creators they love, when the distribution of that money gets decided by other people?\nIt would require a lot of benefits;\n1). Many whales can only be bother with so many subscription.\nOne of the major reason WOW had such a stranglehold on the MMO market is because WOW players already had a subscription, they didn't want another.\nHaving one centralised subscription will give whales a much easier time keeping track of what they're spending.\nA much smaller barrier to entry exists between getting whales to increase their subscription than exist between whales and getting a new subscription. So once they start their subscription here it will snow-ball.\nWith that in mind, empeople could even start their subscription off using just the earnings they've already made on Empeopled.\n2). A better deal for content creators.\nEmpeopled can give content creators a bigger slice of the pie thanks to the cheaper transfer cost of its Bitcoin based system. This could encourage content creators to direct their whales to Empeopled.\nI'm not certain but I'd guess the operating costs scale more cheaply for Empeopled than for Youtube or even Patreon.\nSubscription could also use an invitation system, new subscription and subscriptions upgrades could be associated with specific content creators who would get a bonus cut added to their share of the treasury.\nAlso consider that content creators are affected by the 80-20 rule too. Not only does 80% of the revenue come from 20% of consumers, only 20% of creators are supported by 80% of consumers. This model with give those 80% that are missing out a better chance.\n3). Support more creators with less.\nInverse to whales being discouraged from having multiple subscription due to logistical issues, there's also the price issue. Subscription often have minimum funding levels of $1-$5 per month, this means supporting 10 creators would mean paying $10-$50 per month.\nHowever with one central subscription distributed to multiple creators, whales can support 10 creators for the base $1-$5 per month. And thanks the BTC option, the minimum funding level could viably be even lower than that.\n4). Pay to win.\nEmpeopled has a leveling system that rewards Empeople for contributing quality content & comments to Empeopled. But Empeopled could also reward empeople for contributing to subscriptions with levels and all the associated benefits.\n5). A tip system that works.\nTip systems have largely failed online. The main reasons for this are two-fold;\nA: Barrier to usage again, it's simply more effort than it's worth to go through the payment process to get small amounts conferred in a single tip to a recipient.\nB: Visibility, tipping is largely used due to public act being visible to many and has an associate social pressure, which doesn't exist online.\nThe central subscription system can fix this, by distributing a portion of the treasury not to content creators but to content consumers as tip tokens. Empeople are given a daily supply of tip tokens (scaling with their subscription level, with a base level for non-subscribers) to give to content creators as they see fit.\nThese tip tokens circumvent the online tipping's failures in a manner of ways;\nA: The barrier is as low as it can go, everyone has the tip tokens already the pay wall is no longer there. Also the daily tip tokens wouldn't go into reserve, Empeople would need to use them or lose them back to the treasury.\nB: When a piece of content receives a tip token it can be prominent displayed, similar to reddit gold, A public comment on the content could be generated confirming the transfer, and the public icon displaying the number of tip token a person has ticks down. This 3-factor visibility would make for a function online tip system in a way only Empeople could do.\nAlso out right buying tip tokens could be a thing.\nI think having Empeopled deliver multiple forms of support, is important as different kinds of support models will fit different types of content. A common complaint on youtube is their focus on paying for play time, hurts animators who produce low-quantity high-quality content.\n6). Subscriber rewards\nHaving a central voting forum as the basis for this systems means a much more diverse array of options for low-level subscribers rewards. The obvious one that jumps to mind is Emotes, Avatars, Badges, & Icons.\nAnother common reward could be subscriber-only polls. A lot of creators want input from their supporters and Empeople polls allow them to do this directly.\nPrivate threads for subscribers could be used for creator AMA/Q&A.\n7). Slice of Pi system - sub-subscription to topics.\nSubscribers don't have to release full control over who their subscription goes to. Each level of subscription could come with slices of pi (radians, as in half the subscription). These can be spent as upgraded form of topic follows, which is tracked separately from follows.\nTopics that get lots of slices, will give its content creators a bigger earnings per vote.\nThis sub-subscription could come with an RSS or emailing list that delivers all content from verified creators to the user.\nI'd also add to this a Topic rating system, that allows everyone to judge topics whole-sale so that quality topics can be rewarded( or punished).\nA lot of what would be needed is already here. To get started Empeopled just needs a subscription system and a way to verify creators (creators deserve much bigger cuts than aggregators).\nThough I'd like to see some reform to the voting system before, anyone relies on it for income.\nThe easiness of clicking on vote means a bias towards easy to consume content, and means titles are often more important than the actual content.\nI recommend 4 fixes for this;\n1) Time-based Vote Scaling - voting already scales to the voter time investment into the site, but the vote should also scale to the amount of time invests into the content. When a user first opens a piece of content it starts a timer going around the vote, for each interval of time that passes before they click it the scales its value up.\n2) 5-level voting - \u2665 \u25b2 \u25a0 \u25bc \u00d8 or Hug Plug Shrug Bug Slug. When viewing content it should be automatically and visibly shrug'd to motivate people to rate it properly. Inversely there should be some barrier to \u2665 or \u00d8, so they aren't always used exclusively instead of \u25b2 or \u25bc. This could be as simple as put a lock on top of \u2665 & \u00d8 so voters have to slide then click to vote.\n3) Vote Categories - votes should be valued different depending on their source, whether it's a vote from a someone with a direct link to the content, from someone who stumbled upon it randomly, from a follower viewing new, or from a follower viewing trending.\nThis is important because the 80-20 rule affects content as well, 20% of the content get 80% of the votes, because votes increase visibility and visibility increase votes. Two identical pieces of content, one with 50 votes and one with 0 votes aren't equally likely to receive 1 more vote, however that inequality is more distinct or less distinct by vote source.\nThe 50 vote content is much more likely to receive a vote from a follower viewing trending, but just as likely to get a vote from someone looking at content at random. So one type of vote should be valued over the other as it's more accurately indicative of its quality.\n4) Infrequency scaling - At the moment people who vote infrequently vote have much less influence than frequent voters. This biases content towards the demographics of people that is able to vote on a lot of content.\nSomeone who votes 100 times a day has a 100x bigger impact on the content that succeed than some one who averages 1 vote a day, I don't think they should have equal impact but I think the infrequent voter should be scaled to have greater impact.\nThis can also be combined with the 5-level voting, such that if certain levels are used infrequently they become meaningful when they are used.\nSorry, for the massive rant. A lot of this is personally motivated, as I read, listen, and watch 100's of webcomics, podcasts, & online videos. But I can only support ~1% of them, not only because of the cost but the logistic of managing 100's or even 10's of subscription would be a nightmare. But I think they are all amazing and want to support as many of them as possible, so if the Empeopled let me support even 2 of them with one subscription I'd be satisfied.\nI'd be happy to give anywhere from 1\u00a2 to $1000 a month, depending on the number of content creators it let me support.",

Where previously there were just a few of us and we were pretty well known, now there will be more active moderators, we will need to do something to distinguish a moderator post/comment from a regular contribution.\nTo that end the current moderators are instigating two new practices for the us and new moderators to use going forward!\nAny posts made on Empeopled by a moderator that are to do with the site running and moderation will now have the tag [Mod Post] in their title (like this post does). Any comments made that are on behalf of the site or made as moderators, rather than just regular comments as users will be prefaced by \"Moderator comment:\" (like this post has been, or for example here).\nThis should make it perfectly clear when someone is acting in their capacity as a moderator, as opposed to commenting or posting as normal.

    "votes": 83,
    "content": "About a month ago, @jackripper proposed the Education topic. I set it through the system, and it got a fair amount of amps (around 350-ish) before it closed down. As you know, the amount of amps needed to pass a topic is 700 (the equivalent of 14 level 50 users, or 28 level 25 users). Having resubmitted the topic proposal for another round of voting, I was just wondering if this was a topic worth having, considering they wouldn't have a place other than General, in my opinion.\nSpeaking of topic propositions, I don't think people have been looking at the topic proposal page lately. The discussion is almost empty on each proposition, partially because it's rather hidden (you have to click the proposition to get to the discussion page; there's no \"X Comments\" button like the main/topic feeds). Do you think the current system effectively satisfies the need for topic creation on Empeopled? If not, what would you change?\nTL;DR:\n1. Do you think Education should be a topic on Empeopled?\n2. Would you change anything about the topic creation system?",

Right now there is the Milestones you complete so I assume the system is already more or less inplace already. This is a longer term goal\nsecond\nMaking a shoutout post every week or month congratulating people for completing shown/hidden Badges/Achievements. Than giving them a virtual badge and adding them onto a list, another solution could be having there icon on a virtual map of Emp (styled like an island with it sectioned for types of topics the badges were completed ect...). This would be somewhat similar to Emp of week but as there is the problem of the \"inner circle\" people getting it I feel there should be something more for people (somewhat similar to a runner up)\nFor both of these too work giving these out would have to be somewhat rare to get. So people would actively try and push for them (similar to how the leveling system works already)\nI feel the second one is best, especially as its a smaller community and can be finished quickly\nThe problem with a few of these being the data needed to sift through, this could be collected by a nomination, site data (which I have basic... but would need more especiall for comments)\nI have included a few proposal images for the badges\nhttp://imgur.com/a/usnn8\n^ shit but just general idea\nThe porposed Badges\nGeneral ones (could be daily or )\n- Active poster\n- Active commeter\n- Best comment\n- Best post (could be collected from the Best of Emp email)\nHarder ones\n- Content Creator (generate content for the site, not posted or linked)\n- Break a Record (so this could be posting something that gets a lot of comments quickly ect...)\n- New and out of the gate (so recently join but very much active @HeardOfMe as an example)\n- Generate content/code to the site (so Dev of the site)\n- Active leader (pushing the community to be better @Stardust for example)\n- Make/manage an active contest/event\n- Emp of week\nRare ones\n- Find a site easter egg (I am currently making a contest that anyone can join like a treasure hunt)\n- Being Knighted by @Aris\nwhats everyones thoughts?\nWould need better names for the Badges aswell :p",

I thought, and was a big proponent of, having the community point out the mistake to the person so that they could correct their actions in the future, but I now regret having taken that position. By getting confrontational you aren't fixing anything, you are just making us look like uptight assholes and pushing new members out. Please stop this. If you can't phrase your criticism in a friendly way, just flag the post and move on, leave it to someone else to point out the error of that users ways. I really don't care if it's a first time violation or not, if you aren't a moderator you don't need to be berating another user for breaking the rules and policies.

    "content": "The arrival of Hearthstone\u2019s next card set, Journey to Un\u2019Goro, comes at a critical point for the game. After three years of adventure add-ons and full-sized expansions, the game has emerged from its infancy and is now firmly into its awkward teenage years. As far as the huge fanbase is concerned, the grace period is over, and every decision made by Team 5 is subjected to the highest level of scrutiny. In my last outing, I considered why the current metagame in particular has been faced with, at times, baffling levels of vitriol from parts of the community. For many of those same reasons, Un\u2019Goro faces a lot of questions.",

They were of course predictable, voting on what they thought was the most overpowered and not what actually was. So Yogg-Saron, Hope's End, Tuskarr Totemic, Fiery War Axe, Barnes, and Call of the Wild bit the bullet.\nBut this wasn't really enough to shake up the meta so Firebat had another twist up his sleeve, each of the seven invited players and the one open qualifier would each get to remove one additional card. These were much more targeted and fully eliminated certain archetypes while forcing many others to adapt, truly opening up the realm of possibilities. You can see the full ban list here, we won't go over each of them in depth, but this is where the hype really started to get going.",

All in all, we believe that Standard will end up being the most fun way to enjoy Hearthstone.\"\nI'm not sure what I think about this yet. I like that you will be able to craft the cards from past adventures, but that kind of sucks for the people who can't even possibly buy the adventures now because that is A LOT of dust. More deck lists? Meh, doesn't matter that much to me, personally; but I've read loads of other people complaining about it.\nEdit: Here is a video of Ben Brode saying pretty much the same thing as the blog.\nhttps://youtu.be/0KNQsYBrNtY",

What a terrible time frame for those of us who have to wake up and go to work Monday morning.\nUpdate: Well, crap! This big ol' storm that is shutting down the East Coast has also shut down the Chattanooga Public Library, meaning that the Fireside Gathering is canceled, too. Shucks. I was looking forward to that. I gotta see about organising one of these in my town.",

    "content": "Millennium Puzzle: Increase the user's IQ by 45 and automatically gains the ability to figure out the game Hearthstone in less than 3 turns.\nExample: You have a girlfriend that has 85 IQ which is below average and never played hearthstone before. If she uses the Millennium Puzzle, her IQ becomes 130 in the top percentiles and a genius that can figure out how to play hearthstone in 3 turns.\nMillennium Eye: Grants you the ability to see your opponent's hand. Same idea as stream sniping, except works on every opponent all the time.\nMillennium Rod: Grants you the ability to command your opponent and play 1 card for him/her once every 3 turns. Basically: Turn 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16.....etc..\nSome Rules:\n-If you do not use this ability, on one of those turns, you have to wait 3 more turns and doesn't pass onto the next.\n-If it's turn 4, and your opponent only have a 4 mana cost and the rest of the cards are above 4 mana. You can choose to play it or not play it, but if you choose not to play it, your opponent can still play it after the mind control. It's play one card not make one move\nMillennium Necklace: At the end of your every turn, you can see the top 3 cards of your deck and their order. Every other turn you end your turn, you can see the second top card of your opponent's deck.\nNote:\n-Cards that shuffle deck counters necklace, such as joust making it more of a counter since you can see the top second card, not the top card.\nThe rest of the Millennium items, I can't think of a good ability to them.\nIf you could pick one Millennium Items, which one would you pick?\nIf everyone could get one Millennium Item, which one would you pick to counter people?\nHow would you feel if only selective few people have a Millennium Item and you don't?\nHow would tournaments enforce ban? I'd suggest metal detector.\nHow would you feel if people with Millennium Item have the ability to trigger \"Shadow Game?\" This inflicts pain whenever players take damage(poor priest, warrior doesn't feel pain if the damage is dealt to armor) and the loser will be horribly punished depending on the lose condition you create for both players. If you in America and go with the American version of Yugioh, then the loser simply gets banished to the shadow realm. Of course, the person with Millennium Item has the upper-hand in winning hearthstone since they have more ability.",

    "content": "Here is my strategy for this year's \"Winter Veil Brawl: The Gift Exchange\"\nBasically the warlock deck compliments the theme of snatching up all the boxes. Void Terrors are best played early game to open your box first and drop a 3/7 the enemy is probably not equipped to handle. Shadowflame combined with PowerOverwhelming or Abusive Sergeant will help clear the board mid game while you reap the rewards!\nOf course I usually feel the legendary cards are best used in these decks for flashiness rather than practicality. Nozdormu is always a favorite in these brawls and I went with Mogor to mix it up a bit late game.\nWas on a winning streak until this legendary defeat",
